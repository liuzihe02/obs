Comics by creators such as Michael Kirwan and Brad Parker were popular in magazines featuring pornographic photos. The ""Meatmen"" anthology series, published from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, featured a variety of gay erotic comics by creators such as Belasco, John Blackburn, The Hun [Bill Schmeling], Shapiro, Jon Macy, Stephen [Dom Orejudos], Tom of Finland, Bill Ward, and Zack [Oliver Frey]. Although gay comics have expanded to cover a variety of genres, erotica has continued to be popular, sometimes incorporated into other genres, such as the erotic superheroes by Patrick Fillion published by Class Comics, and the wordless graphic novels written by Dale Lazarov.

It was later reported that there were no complaints about Steines' behavior and that the show was merely taking a different creative direction. Steines' contract had not expired and he was not informed until after he had taped what was his last show.

The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties."" He argued that the other countries of the world ""all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States."" The Japanese term """"Shina"""" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for ""China"". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used ""Shina"" extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped ""Shina"" as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with ""Zhonghua minguo"" or simply ""Zhongguo"". Liang went on to argue that the concept of ""tianxia"" had to be abandoned in favor of ""guojia"", that is, ""nation,"" for which he accepted the term ""Zhongguo"". After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, ""Zhongguo"" was also adopted as the abbreviation of ""Zhonghua minguo"".
