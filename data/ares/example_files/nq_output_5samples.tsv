Comics by creators such as Michael Kirwan and Brad Parker were popular in magazines featuring pornographic photos. The ""Meatmen"" anthology series, published from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, featured a variety of gay erotic comics by creators such as Belasco, John Blackburn, The Hun [Bill Schmeling], Shapiro, Jon Macy, Stephen [Dom Orejudos], Tom of Finland, Bill Ward, and Zack [Oliver Frey]. Although gay comics have expanded to cover a variety of genres, erotica has continued to be popular, sometimes incorporated into other genres, such as the erotic superheroes by Patrick Fillion published by Class Comics, and the wordless graphic novels written by Dale Lazarov.
