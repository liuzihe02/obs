",introduction to visual merchandising and relation to the consumer,"Visual merchandising is a strategy used by retailers to attract customers to their store and influence their buying behavior. It involves the presentation of the store and its merchandise in a way that aligns with the retailer's goals and marketing strategy. The visual merchandiser's role is crucial as they not only help bring customers to the store but also influence their purchasing decisions, akin to ""making the horse drink"" as per G. Surrendar's analogy. Particularly, visual merchandising related to shop windows has been found to significantly impact consumer buying behavior, with variations observed based on gender and the store attributes most valued by consumers in shopping centers.",PASS,RAGTruth

If your porch has open rafters, use the staple gun to attach the netting to the top of the porch. The netting keeps the birds from reaching those spaces they often choose to build their nests.ird nests can block your ventilation systems, are made from flammable materials, and bird droppings can transmit disease. You can keep birds from nesting on your porch with different products designed to scare birds away from your property.

passage 2:1. Install bird netting over the top of the light fixture to block the birds' access to it. Choose a netting that is nonflammable and safe to use around light bulbs. Beware that the netting is installed so that it doesn't entangle birds. If you can't use netting on your light fixture, try another method.nstall bird netting over the top of the light fixture to block the birds' access to it.

You can keep birds from nesting on your porch with different products designed to scare birds away from your property.

",how can i keep birds from building a nest on my porch,"One way to keep birds from building a nest on your porch is to attach bird netting to the eaves or top of the porch with a staple gun. This netting prevents birds from accessing the spaces they typically choose for nest building. Another option is to install bird netting over the top of any light fixtures on the porch to block the birds' access to them. Additionally, mounting a plastic hawk on or near the porch can deter birds as they perceive it as a predator. It is important to periodically move the plastic hawk to prevent birds from becoming accustomed to it.",PASS,RAGTruth

3220,13156,"passage 1:The physiological benefits of hugging. Hugs make you feel good for a reason and it's not just the loving embrace that gives us that warm feeling in our hearts. It's much more. It affects the entire body to such an extent that many scientists claim it is equivalent to the effect of many different drugs operating on the body simultaneously.

passage 2:Empathy and Listening Skills. and. Psychological Hugs. The use of empathy and listening skills--empathic listening--sometimes leads to good relationships, emotional intimacy, and happy marriages. Their use may also lead to a conversation partner feeling like she or he is receiving a hug--a psychological hug..

passage 3:In a study on fears and self-esteem, research published in the journal Psychological Science revealed that hugs and touch significantly reduce worry of mortality. The studies found that hugging -- even if it was just an inanimate object like a teddy bear -- helps soothe individuals' existential fears.

",psychological effects of hugging,"Based on the given passages, here are the psychological effects of hugging:

1. Reduces stress and anxiety: Hugging releases oxytocin, which can lower blood pressure and heart rate, and reduce stress and anxiety (Passage 1).
2. Improves mood and well-being: Hugs can boost feelings of happiness and social connection, leading to improved overall mood and well-being (Passage 1).
3. Enhances empathy and listening skills: Physical touch, such as hugging, can increase empathy and improve listening skills, leading to better relationships and emotional intimacy (Passage 2).
4. Soothes existential fears: Hugging can help alleviate fears of mortality and provide a sense of comfort and security (Passage 3).

1227,26804311,"Electronic (e)-cigarette use is rapidly rising, with 20 % of Americans ages 25-44 now using these drug delivery devices. E-cigarette users expose their airways, cells of host defense, and colonizing bacteria to e-cigarette vapor (EV). Here, we report that exposure of human epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface to fresh EV (vaped from an e-cigarette device) resulted in dose-dependent cell death. After exposure to EV, cells of host defense-epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils-had reduced antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Mouse inhalation of EV for 1 h daily for 4 weeks led to alterations in inflammatory markers within the airways and elevation of an acute phase reactant in serum. Upon exposure to e-cigarette vapor extract (EVE), airway colonizer SA had increased biofilm formation, adherence and invasion of epithelial cells, resistance to human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, and up-regulation of virulence genes. EVE-exposed SA were more virulent in a mouse model of pneumonia. These data suggest that e-cigarettes may be toxic to airway cells, suppress host defenses, and promote inflammation over time, while also promoting virulence of colonizing bacteria.",Does electronic cigarette inhalation alter innate immunity and airway cytokines while increasing the virulence of colonizing bacteria?,Yes. Acute exposure to e-cigarette vapor (EV) is cytotoxic to airway cells in vitro. Acute exposure to EV decreases macrophage and neutrophil antimicrobial function. Inhalation of EV alters immunomodulating cytokines in the airways of mice. Inhalation of EV leads to increased markers of inflammation in BAL and serum. Staphylococcus aureus become more virulent when exposed to EV.,PASS,pubmedQA
1417,15041487,"The effect of altered occlusion on the mandibular condylar cartilage remains unclear.
This study investigated the effect of unilateral incisor disocclusion on cartilage thickness, on mitotic activity and on chondrocytes maturation and differentiation in the mandibular condylar cartilage of rats.
The upper and lower left incisors were trimmed 2mm every second day in five rats. In other five rats, the incisor occlusion was not altered. Condylar tissues from both sides of each mandible were processed and stained for Herovici's stain and immunohistochemistry for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN). Measurements of cartilage thickness and the numbers of immunopositive cells for each antibody were analysed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
No significant differences were observed in cartilage thickness after 7 days of unilateral incisor disocclusion. However, the numbers of immunopositive cells for BrdU as a marker of DNA synthesising cells, TGF-beta1 as a marker of chondrocytes differentiation, and ALP and OCN as markers of chondrocytes maturation, were significant higher in the cartilage cells on both sides when incisor occlusion was unilaterally altered. Interestingly, alkaline phosphatase was highly expressed on the condylar side of incisor disocclusion, whereas osteocalcin was highly expressed on the side opposite to the incisor disocclusion.",Does incisor disocclusion in rats affect mandibular condylar cartilage at the cellular level?,"Yes. It is demonstrated that after 7 days, unilateral incisor disocclusion affects the mandibular condylar cartilage at the cellular level by increasing the mitotic activity and by accelerating chondrocytes maturation. Chondrocytes maturation appears more accelerated on the side opposite to incisor disocclusion.",PASS,pubmedQA

1917,27638845,"The relationship between meniscal tears and other joint pathologies with patient-reported symptoms is not clear. We investigated associations between structural knee pathologies identified at surgery with preoperative knee pain and function in patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscal surgery.
This study included 443 patients from the Knee Arthroscopy Cohort Southern Denmark (KACS), a prospective cohort following patients 18 years or older undergoing arthroscopic meniscal surgery at 4 hospitals between 1 February 2013 and 31 January 2014. Patient-reported outcomes, including the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), were obtained by online questionnaires prior to surgery. Knee pathology was assessed by the operating surgeons using a modified version of the International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine (ISAKOS) classification of meniscal tears questionnaire, supplemented with information extracted from surgery reports. Following hypothesis-driven preselection of candidate variables, backward elimination regressions were performed to investigate associations between patient-reported outcomes and structural knee pathologies.
