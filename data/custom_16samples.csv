15345,"passage 1:Outdoor hiking has a myriad of benefits for both the body and the mind. Hiking is inexpensive and easy to start, so you can participate no matter how fit you currently are. Most people live within driving distance of wonderful hiking spots and discovering these places is a good way of getting to know an area. Here's a look at some of the benefits of hiking. Outdoor Hiking Promotes Mental Health. Hiking is much more varied than many other types of exercise, particularly those undertaken in a gym.

passage 2:Being exposed to sunshine will also increase your levels of vitamin D. Hiking is a cardiovascular activity, depending on how hard you push yourself during a hike, and thus has benefits for your cardiovascular system, such as reducing the chances of heart disease, and increasing your overall fitness.

passage 3:Research shows that hiking has a positive impact on combating the symptoms of stress and anxiety, says Gregory A. Miller, PhD, president of the American Hiking Society. Being in nature is ingrained in our DNA, and we sometimes forget that.

",benefits of hiking as a hobby facts,"Based on the provided passages, here are the benefits of hiking as a hobby:

1. Promotes mental health: Hiking is a form of outdoor recreation that promotes mental well-being by exposing individuals to nature and allowing them to disconnect from their daily routines (Passage 1).
2. Increases vitamin D levels: Spending time outdoors while hiking exposes individuals to sunlight, which helps to increase vitamin D levels (Passage 2).
3. Improves cardiovascular health: Hiking is a cardiovascular activity that can help reduce the risk of heart disease and improve overall fitness (Passage 2).
4. Combats stress and anxiety: Research suggests that hiking has a positive impact on reducing symptoms of stress and anxiety (Passage 3).

Unable to answer based on given passages. The passages do not provide information on the following benefits of hiking:

* Building muscle strength and endurance
* Improving balance and coordination
* Enhancing cognitive function
* Reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes

The passages primarily focus on the mental and physical health benefits of hiking, but do not provide information on other potential advantages of the activity.",FAIL,RAGTruth

passage 3:The Snapchat app is used on an iPhone. Snapchat allows users' messages to vanish after seconds. (Photo by Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images) | Peter Macdiarmid via Getty Images. We've noticed that you're using a third-party application to access Snapchat, putting yourself (and possibly your friends) at risk.ast month, 200,000 private Snapchat photos were leaked via one of the photo messaging app's many third-party apps. Now, the company is taking steps to punish individuals who use those apps.

",why is my snapchat temporarily locked,"Based on the given passages, it appears that your Snapchat account may be temporarily locked due to using third-party apps to access the service. Snapchat does not support or condone the use of third-party apps, as they can pose a security risk to users' accounts. The company has been known to lock out accounts that have been accessed using third-party apps, and may send a message warning users before doing so.

To regain access to your account, you may need to uninstall any third-party apps you have installed and wait for an official Snapchat app to become available for your device. Additionally, it's recommended to change your password and ensure that you're using the latest version of the Snapchat app.

If you're still having trouble accessing your account, you may want to contact Snapchat support for further assistance.",FAIL,RAGTruth

25886616,"The transcription factor Ecotropic Virus Integration site 1 (EVI1) regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and its overexpression contributes to an aggressive course of disease in myeloid leukemias and other malignancies. Notwithstanding, knowledge about the target genes mediating its biological and pathological functions remains limited. We therefore aimed to identify and characterize novel EVI1 target genes in human myeloid cells.
U937T_EVI1, a human myeloid cell line expressing EVI1 in a tetracycline regulable manner, was subjected to gene expression profiling. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the regulation of membrane-spanning-4-domains subfamily-A member-3 (MS4A3) by EVI1. Reporter constructs containing various parts of the MS4A3 upstream region were employed in luciferase assays, and binding of EVI1 to the MS4A3 promoter was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. U937 derivative cell lines experimentally expressing EVI1 and/or MS4A3 were generated by retroviral transduction, and tested for their tumorigenicity by subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficient mice.
Gene expression microarray analysis identified 27 unique genes that were up-regulated, and 29 unique genes that were down-regulated, in response to EVI1 induction in the human myeloid cell line U937T. The most strongly repressed gene was MS4A3, and its down-regulation by EVI1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR in additional, independent experimental model systems. MS4A3 mRNA levels were also negatively correlated with those of EVI1 in several published AML data sets. Reporter gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that EVI1 regulated MS4A3 via direct binding to a promoter proximal region. Experimental re-expression of MS4A3 in an EVI1 overexpressing cell line counteracted the tumor promoting effect of EVI1 in a murine xenograft model by increasing the rate of apoptosis.",Does eVI1 promote tumor growth via transcriptional repression of MS4A3?,"Yes. Our data reveal MS4A3 as a novel direct target of EVI1 in human myeloid cells, and show that its repression plays a role in EVI1 mediated tumor aggressiveness.",PASS,pubmedQA

2 large nursing homes in Turin, Italy.
418 dependent elderly (83 males, 335 females, mean age 83.7+/-8.5 y, range 55-102) living in the nursing homes.
the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was evaluated using a Doppler Ultrasound measurement of AAI (Ankle/Arm blood pressure Index). Death causes according to ICD-9-CM were ascertained on patient's clinical records.
Diagnosis of PAD was made in 122 subjects (29.2%) with AAI<0.90. After a 3 year follow-up 203 patients (48.6%) died. The presence of PAD was not related to total mortality or to mortality for ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease or other causes. IHD mortality was significantly and independently related to low haemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy and poor mobility conditions.",Is ankle/arm pressure predictive for cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes?,"No. The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.",PASS,pubmedQA
20521332,"Among people with arthritis, the need for work transitions may signal a risk for more adverse work outcomes in the future, such as permanent work loss. Our aim was to evaluate the ability of the Work Instability Scale for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA-WIS) to predict arthritis-related work transitions within a 12-month period.
Workers with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 250) from 3 clinical sites participated in self-administered surveys that assessed the impact of health on employment at multiple time points over 12 months. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to assess the ability of the RA-WIS (range 0-23, where 23 = highest work instability) to predict 4 types of work transition: reductions in work hours, disability leaves of absence, changes in job/occupation, or temporary unemployment, assembled as a composite outcome. Covariates assessed include age, sex, education, marital status, income, pain intensity, disease duration, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCCs) were also assessed to further examine the predictive ability of the RA-WIS and to determine optimal cut points for predicting specific work transitions.
After 12 months, 21.7% (n = 50 of 230) of the participants had indicated at least one arthritis-related work transition. Higher baseline RA-WIS was predictive of such an outcome (relative risk [RR] 1.05 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.00-1.11]), particularly at >17 (RR 2.30 [95% CI 1.11-4.77]). The RA-WIS cut point of >13 was found to be most accurate for prediction (AUROCC 0.68 [95% CI 0.58-0.78]).",Does the Work Instability Scale for rheumatoid arthritis predict arthritis-related work transitions within 12 months?,"No. The RA-WIS did not demonstrate the ability to predict arthritis-related work transitions within a short timeframe, and is not a promising measurement candidate for risk prognostication where work disability outcomes are of concern.",FAIL,pubmedQA
