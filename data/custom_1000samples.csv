passage 2:Fire is the mechanism by which the forest is continually regenerated, states Hall. Fires consume dead, decaying vegetation accumulating on the forest floor, thereby clearing the way for new growth. Some species, such as the jack pine, even rely on fire to spread their seeds. The jack pine produces seratonous (resin-filled) cones that are very durable. The cones remain dormant until a fire occurs and melts the resin. Then the cones pop open and the seeds fall or blow out. In the Canadian boreal forest, aspen and jack pine are the most important ‘pioneer species’, observes Hall.

passage 3:Spruce have better access to sunlight while shading the other trees with their more dense canopies. Consequently, the jack pine and aspen begin dying out in regions where spruce trees are plentiful. But, should another fire come and disturb this cycle, the more fire-tolerant jack pine and aspen regain the advantage and again proliferate.

Additionally, passage 3 suggests that while spruce trees may outcompete jack pine and aspen in some areas, fires can disrupt this cycle and allow jack pine and aspen to regain an advantage.

Toprol can be taken once a day and Lopressor is usually taken at least twice a day.

passage 2:Tartrate vs Succinate. The key difference between tartrate and succinate is that succinate is derived from the succinic acid and tartrate is derived from the tartaric acid. These two chemical substances are widely used in the beverage industry and drug manufacturing.Succinic acid is ethan-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. Succinate form of metoprolol is an extended release drug and it plays its role in the circulatory system for 24 hours. However, the tartrate form of metoprolol does not appear in the blood stream for 24 hours because metoprolol tartrate is an immediate-release drug.

passage 3:Release time. The primary difference between metoprolol succinate and metoprolol tartrate is the length of time that the drugs stay in your bloodstream. Metoprolol succinate will stay in a person's bloodstream for 24 complete hours. This means that the medication is a once per day pill.Metoprolol tartrate, on the other hand, will not stay in the bloodstream as long and thus needs to be taken at regular intervals.etoprolol succinate has a greater dehydrating effect. Thus, the side effects constipation and dry mouth are primarily associated with this version of the medication. Conversely, metoprolol tartrate may cause diarrhea. It also has the potential to cause sleep issues such as insomnia or unusual dreams.

Conjoined twins: When the division of the developing zygote into 2 embryos occurs, 99% of the time it is within 8 days of fertilization. Mortality is highest for conjoined twins due to the many complications resulting from shared organs.

passage 3:Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy. Twins can be either monozygotic (identical), meaning that they develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic (fraternal), meaning that they develop from two different eggs. In fraternal twins, each twin is fertilized by its own sperm cell. In contrast, a fetus that develops alone in the womb is called a singleton, and the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is multiple. Non-related look-alikes whose resemblance parallels that of twins are referred to as doppelgangers.

We are looking at the difference between elements, compounds, and mixtures. Elements are the purest form of a chemical substance and are composed of only one type of atom. In other words, all of the atoms in an element will have the same number of protons.

",differences between elements compounds and mixtures,"Based on the given passages, the main differences between elements, compounds, and mixtures are:

* Elements are the purest form of a chemical substance and are composed of only one type of atom. They have a fixed composition and cannot be broken down into simpler substances by physical means.
* Compounds, on the other hand, are substances composed of two or more different elements that are chemically bonded together. They have a fixed composition and are pure substances.
* Mixtures are physical combinations of elements or compounds where the parts of the mixture are not chemically bonded and retain their own identity. They have a variable composition and can be separated by physical means.

Therefore, the key differences between elements, compounds, and mixtures are their composition, bonding, and separability.

If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.

passage 2:Question: Why should I want to serve God?. Answer: The fact that we should serve God is obvious in Scripture (see Luke 4:8). Why we should want to serve God is a more difficult question. Every Christian asked might have a different reason for serving God; different people are motivated by different things.However, the Bible does make clear that, when a person is in a real relationship with God, he will serve God.We should want to serve God because we know Him; an inherent part of knowing Him is a desire to serve Him. It’s always been God’s intention to make us like His Son, Jesus (Romans 8:29).f you want to want to serve God, the key is to get to know Him! Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal more of God to you (John 16:13). When we truly know God, who is love (1 John 4:8), our natural response is a desire to love and serve Him in return.

passage 3:If we are serving others for those reasons, we are not serving or loving properly. Instead, we are serving others as a way to serve ourselves. This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t choose to serve if we feel it is the right thing to do in a given situation or to build and strengthen our character muscles.hen we learn to serve in this way our rewards are so much greater than if we were to serve with self-serving motives. Because we serve out of love with no stipulations or expectations of anything in return, it no longer matters what we get out of it.

",why should we serve others,"Based on the given passages, here's a brief answer to the question ""Why should we serve others?""

We should serve others because it is a way to show love and kindness to everyone, even those who may not treat us well. Serving others is an expression of our love for God and our desire to be like Him. When we truly know God, our natural response is a desire to love and serve Him in return, and serving others is a way to do so.

That's the concept behind your carbon footprint, which is one method of measuring the environmental effect of your lifestyle. A carbon footprint, measured in tons, indicates the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are produced as a result of your daily activities. You can reduce your footprint by changing the way you live your life. Even seemingly tiny changes can make a significant difference.

passage 2:It all comes back to the average carbon footprint. The average per capita carbon footprint is 6 tons per year. In the U.S. the average is 20 tons per year, and a third of that is created by automobile emissions -- meaning your car itself can put out over 6 tons of C02 a year -- enough for two people.

passage 3:So what exactly is a carbon footprint? In simplest terms, carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases produced by various human activities within a given time frame. Carbon footprint is usually measured in tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere. Your home has a carbon footprint if you use oil, coal or gas to heat it. That cheeseburger at your favorite restaurant has a carbon footprint: raising the beef and wheat and operating the restaurant all involves greenhouse gases. Your car has a carbon footprint, dependent on the vehicle’s fuel consumption and driving distance.

",what is the effect of carbon footprint,"Based on the given passages, it is clear that the effect of a carbon footprint is a measure of the negative impact of human activities on the environment.

passage 2:Fire is the mechanism by which the forest is continually regenerated, states Hall. Fires consume dead, decaying vegetation accumulating on the forest floor, thereby clearing the way for new growth. Some species, such as the jack pine, even rely on fire to spread their seeds. The jack pine produces seratonous (resin-filled) cones that are very durable. The cones remain dormant until a fire occurs and melts the resin. Then the cones pop open and the seeds fall or blow out. In the Canadian boreal forest, aspen and jack pine are the most important ‘pioneer species’, observes Hall.

passage 3:Spruce have better access to sunlight while shading the other trees with their more dense canopies. Consequently, the jack pine and aspen begin dying out in regions where spruce trees are plentiful. But, should another fire come and disturb this cycle, the more fire-tolerant jack pine and aspen regain the advantage and again proliferate.

This is accomplished by using a small amount of electricity to control a gate on a much larger supply of electricity, much like turning a valve to control a supply of water.he base pulls these electrons from the emitter because it has a more positive voltage than does the emitter. This movement of electrons creates a flow of electricity through the transistor. The current passes from the emitter to the collector through the base.

passage 2:A transistor is a miniature electronic component that can do two different jobs. It can work either as an amplifier or a switch: 1  When it works as an amplifier, it takes in a tiny electric current at one end (an input current) and produces a much bigger electric current (an output current) at the other.2  Transistors can also work as switches.ormally, the holes in the base act like a barrier, preventing any significant current flow from the emitter to the collector while the transistor is in its off state. A transistor works when the electrons and the holes start moving across the two junctions between the n-type and p-type silicon.

",what is a transistor how does it work,"Sure, I'll do my best to help you! Here's a brief answer to your question based on the given passages:

A transistor is a semiconductor device that can function as an amplifier or a switch. It consists of three layers of a semiconductor material with different electrical properties, known as the base, collector, and emitter. The base is connected to a voltage source, and the collector and emitter are connected to the input and output circuits, respectively. When a small voltage is applied to the base, it controls the flow of current between the collector and emitter, allowing the transistor to act as an amplifier or a switch. The transistor can amplify a weak signal by multiplying it with a factor called beta (β), which is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors.

",why am i not getting a toned body if i do extersice every day,"Based on the provided passages, here's my answer:

If you are not getting a toned body despite exercising every day, it could be due to two reasons:

1. Lack of muscle mass: As passage 1 states, having muscle is essential for having a toned body. If you don't have enough muscle mass, no amount of exercise will give you a toned appearance. You may need to focus on building muscle through strength training exercises before worrying about reducing body fat.
2. High body fat percentage: Passage 2 emphasizes that having a low body fat percentage is necessary to achieve a toned look. If you have a high body fat percentage, it will be harder to see your muscle definition, regardless of how much you exercise. To reduce body fat, you may need to adjust your diet and focus on burning fat through cardiovascular exercises.

passage 2:Fire is the mechanism by which the forest is continually regenerated, states Hall. Fires consume dead, decaying vegetation accumulating on the forest floor, thereby clearing the way for new growth. Some species, such as the jack pine, even rely on fire to spread their seeds. The jack pine produces seratonous (resin-filled) cones that are very durable. The cones remain dormant until a fire occurs and melts the resin. Then the cones pop open and the seeds fall or blow out. In the Canadian boreal forest, aspen and jack pine are the most important ‘pioneer species’, observes Hall.

passage 3:Spruce have better access to sunlight while shading the other trees with their more dense canopies. Consequently, the jack pine and aspen begin dying out in regions where spruce trees are plentiful. But, should another fire come and disturb this cycle, the more fire-tolerant jack pine and aspen regain the advantage and again proliferate.

",how are forest fires beneficial to conifers like jack pines?,"Based on the given passages, forest fires are beneficial to conifers like jack pines because they:

1. Provide a mechanism for the tree to regenerate and grow rapidly after a fire (Passage 1).
2. Clear the way for new growth by consuming dead, decaying vegetation on the forest floor (Passage 2).
3. Spread their seeds through serotinous cones that open during a fire, allowing the tree to propagate (Passage 2).

Therefore, forest fires play a crucial role in the life cycle of jack pines and other conifers in the Canadian boreal forest.",FAIL,RAGTruth

",why am i not getting a toned body if i do extersice every day,"Based on the given passages, it seems that having a toned body is dependent on two main factors: having muscle mass and having a low enough body fat percentage to reveal the muscle.

If you are exercising regularly but not seeing any improvements in your physique, there could be several reasons why. Here are a few possibilities:

1. Lack of proper nutrition: Exercise alone is not enough to achieve a toned body. You need to make sure you're consuming a balanced diet that provides your body with the necessary nutrients to build muscle and burn fat.
2. Insufficient rest and recovery: Muscles grow during rest and recovery, not during exercise. If you're not giving your body enough time to recover between workouts, you may not be allowing your muscles to fully repair and rebuild, which can hinder your progress.
3. Inconsistent training: Consistency is key when it comes to building muscle and achieving a toned body. If you're not exercising regularly or consistently, you may not be making the gains you desire.
4. Lack of progressive overload: Progressive overload refers to gradually increasing the intensity of your workouts over time to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth. If you're not challenging yourself enough, you may not be making the gains you want.
5. Poor form and technique: If you're not using proper form and technique during your workouts, you may not be targeting the muscles effectively, which can hinder your progress.

Nonessential amino acids can be made by the body, while essential amino acids cannot be made by the body so you must get them from your diet.

",what is the difference between essential and nonessential amino acids,"The main difference between essential and non-essential amino acids is that the human body cannot produce essential amino acids on its own and therefore must obtain them from the diet, whereas non-essential amino acids can either be produced by the body or obtained from the diet. Essential amino acids are also referred to as ""limiting"" amino acids, meaning that the body cannot synthesize them and thus they must be obtained from outside sources. In contrast, non-essential amino acids are considered ""dispensable"" because the body can either synthesize them or obtain them from the diet.

Essential amino acids are vital for various bodily functions such as protein synthesis, tissue repair, and muscle growth. There are nine essential amino acids that humans need to consume regularly: valine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and histidine (which is only essential for infants). Non-essential amino acids, on the other hand, are still important for various physiological processes, but the body can produce them independently or obtain them from the diet.

With that said, here are a few cases when pie charts work best: 1  When you have only a few data points to display, and each one is substantially different in scale.he y-axis will have a scale, and each bar’s height should be proportionate to the size of the category it represents. This can create a problem if you have very disproportionate responses that impact the scale of your graph, so keep that in mind when formatting.

",show me how can i make gragh for my research,"Based on the given passages, here are the steps to create a bar graph for your research:

1. Collect your data: Before creating a bar graph, you need to collect all the data you will be using for the graph. Make sure the data is relevant and relates to the purpose of your research.
2. Determine the categories: Identify the categories you will be comparing in your bar graph. These categories should be represented by the different bars in your graph.
3. Choose a scale: Decide on the scale you will use for the y-axis (vertical axis) of your graph. Each bar's height should be proportionate to the size of the category it represents.
4. Title your graph: Give your graph a clear and descriptive title that reflects the topic of your research.
5. Create your graph: Use graph paper to create your bar graph. Each bar should represent one category, and the height of each bar should be proportional to the value of that category. Make sure to label each bar with the name of the category it represents.
6. Add a key: Include a key or legend to explain the meaning of each bar. This will help your audience understand the data displayed in your graph.
7. Finalize your graph: Once you have created your graph, review it to ensure that the scales are accurate and the labels are clear. Make any necessary adjustments before presenting your graph.

Remember, a bar graph is a great way to compare different categories and show their relationships. It is important to choose appropriate scales and labels to ensure that your graph is easy to read and understand.",FAIL,RAGTruth

Draw the shape you want to make. Example: A cone with a 6” diameter base, a height of 5 inches and a top diameter of 3.50 inches.

passage 2:The truncated cone is a lot like a lampshade. I've drawn one below with some helping lines labelled t, b, h and w : So t is the diameter of the circular top of the cone, b is the diameter of the circular bottom, h is the height of the cone and w is the diagonal width. You have measurements for all these except w.

",how to draw a truncated cone in geogebra,"Based on the given passages, here are the steps to draw a truncated cone in GeoGebra:

1. Draw a circle with a diameter equal to the base diameter of the truncated cone.
2. Draw a second circle with a diameter equal to the top diameter of the truncated cone.
3. Draw a line connecting the center of the two circles.
4. Extend the line until it intersects the first circle at a point.
5. Draw a vertical line from the point where the line intersects the first circle to the center of the second circle.
6. Draw a third circle with a diameter equal to the height of the truncated cone, centered at the point where the vertical line intersects the second circle.
7. Use the Arc Tool to create an arc between the two circles, using the height of the truncated cone as the radius.
8. Use the Polygon Tool to create a polygon with the arc as its boundary.
9. Adjust the dimensions of the polygon to match the measurements of the truncated cone.

Alternatively, you can also use the 3D capabilities of GeoGebra to create a truncated cone. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open GeoGebra and click on the 3D menu.
2. Click on the ""Cone"" tool and enter the dimensions of the truncated cone, making sure to select the ""Truncated"" option.
3. Adjust the dimensions of the cone to match the measurements of the truncated cone.

Notwithstanding, knowledge about the target genes mediating its biological and pathological functions remains limited. We therefore aimed to identify and characterize novel EVI1 target genes in human myeloid cells.
U937T_EVI1, a human myeloid cell line expressing EVI1 in a tetracycline regulable manner, was subjected to gene expression profiling. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the regulation of membrane-spanning-4-domains subfamily-A member-3 (MS4A3) by EVI1. Reporter constructs containing various parts of the MS4A3 upstream region were employed in luciferase assays, and binding of EVI1 to the MS4A3 promoter was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. U937 derivative cell lines experimentally expressing EVI1 and/or MS4A3 were generated by retroviral transduction, and tested for their tumorigenicity by subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficient mice.
Gene expression microarray analysis identified 27 unique genes that were up-regulated, and 29 unique genes that were down-regulated, in response to EVI1 induction in the human myeloid cell line U937T. The most strongly repressed gene was MS4A3, and its down-regulation by EVI1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR in additional, independent experimental model systems. MS4A3 mRNA levels were also negatively correlated with those of EVI1 in several published AML data sets. Reporter gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that EVI1 regulated MS4A3 via direct binding to a promoter proximal region. Experimental re-expression of MS4A3 in an EVI1 overexpressing cell line counteracted the tumor promoting effect of EVI1 in a murine xenograft model by increasing the rate of apoptosis.",Does eVI1 promote tumor growth via transcriptional repression of MS4A3?,"Yes.

1374,27249091,"To examine the potential differential impact of childhood trauma, according to the age at the time of exposure, on the psychopathological profile of patients with early psychosis treated in a specialized 3-year program during the early phase of the disease.
196 subjects with early psychosis aged 18-35 years were followed up prospectively over 36 months of treatment between 2004 and 2010. Patients who had faced at least 1 experience of abuse (physical, sexual, or emotional) or neglect (physical or emotional) were classified according to age at the time of the first exposure (early trauma: before 12 years of age; late trauma: from age 12 through 16 years) and then compared with unexposed patients (nontrauma). The level of symptoms was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Young Mania Rating Scale, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale.
Exposure to 1 or more forms of trauma before 16 years of age was present in 31.63% of patients. Comparisons over the 3 years of treatment with the nontrauma patients revealed that (1) patients with early trauma showed consistently higher levels of positive (P = .006), depressive (P = .001), manic (P = .006), and negative (P = .029) symptoms and (2) patients with late trauma showed only more negative symptoms (P = .029).",Does age at the time of exposure to trauma modulate the psychopathological profile in patients with early psychosis?,"Yes.

1155,19357361,"Identifying the cues required for the survival and development of photoreceptors is essential for treating retinal neurodegeneration. The authors previously established that glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulates proliferation and that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) promotes photoreceptor survival and differentiation. Later findings that ceramide triggers photoreceptor apoptosis suggested sphingolipids might also control photoreceptor development. The present study investigated whether sphingosine-1-phophate (S1P), which promotes survival and differentiation in several cell types, regulates photoreceptor proliferation and differentiation and whether it is a mediator in GDNF and DHA effects.
Rat retina neuronal cultures were supplemented at day 0 or 1 with S1P, GDNF, or DHA and were treated with DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine to inhibit S1P synthesis or with brefeldin A (BFA) to block intracellular trafficking. Proliferation was quantified to determine bromodeoxyuridine uptake and number of mitotic figures. Opsin, peripherin, and sphingosine kinase (SphK), the enzyme required for S1P synthesis, were quantified by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis.
S1P increased the proliferation of photoreceptor progenitors. It also stimulated the formation of apical processes, enhanced opsin and peripherin expression, and promoted their localization in these processes; DHA had similar effects. BFA prevented S1P and DHA enhancement of apical process formation without affecting opsin expression. GDNF and DHA enhanced SphK expression in photoreceptors, while inhibiting S1P synthesis blocked GDNF mitogenic effects and DHA effects on differentiation.",Is sphingosine-1-phosphate a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in retina photoreceptors?,"Yes. The authors propose S1P as a key regulator in photoreceptor development. GDNF and DHA might upregulate SphK levels to promote S1P synthesis, which would initially promote proliferation and then advance photoreceptor differentiation.",PASS,pubmedQA
1104,11683916,"DNA replication-related element binding factor (DREF) has been suggested to be involved in regulation of DNA replication- and proliferation-related genes in Drosophila. While the effects on the mutation in the DNA replication-related element (DRE) in cultured cells have been studied extensively, the consequences of elevating wild-type DREF activity in developing tissues have hitherto remained unclear.
We over-expressed DREF in the wing imaginal disc using a GAL4-UAS targeted expression system in Drosophila. Over-expression of DREF induced a notching wing phenotype, which was associated with ectopic apoptosis. A half reduction of the reaper, head involution defective and grim gene dose suppressed this DREF-induced notching wing phenotype. Furthermore, this was also the case with co-expression of baculovirus P35, a caspase inhibitor. In addition, over-expression of the 32 kDa boundary element-associated factor (BEAF-32), thought to compete against DREF for common binding sites in genomic regions, rescued the DREF-induced notching wing phenotype, while a half reduction of the genomic region, including the BEAF-32 gene, exerted enhancing effects. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for a genetic interaction between DREF and BEAF-32.",Does over-expression of DREF in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc induce apoptosis and a notching wing phenotype?,Yes.

1394,10918163,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is known to be a proinflammatory cytokine and glucocorticoid-induced immunomodulator as well as a regulator of tumor growth. Although positive and negative effects of MIF on tumor cell growth have been reported, to the authors' knowledge the precise role of MIF in tumorigenesis remains unclear. In the current study the authors assessed expression of MIF protein and mRNA in lung adenocarcinomas with regard to patient prognosis.
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tissue specimens surgically obtained from 74 patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer pathologic Stages I, II, and IIIa). In addition, expression of MIF mRNA in the cancerous tissue was investigated using in situ hybridization. Patient prognosis was evaluated with regard to MIF expression levels and its distribution was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.
MIF mRNA and MIF protein were observed in the bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelium, vascular smooth muscle, and alveolar macrophages in the normal lung tissue. In tumor tissue from lung adenocarcinoma specimens, both MIF mRNA and protein were observed at much higher levels than in the normal alveolar epithelium. MIF protein was observed diffusely in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in all tumor specimens examined.

Retrospective clinical investigation in a medical ICU.
Eighty-one consecutive patients admitted to ICU, with a body temperature of 35 degrees C or lower and rewarmed passively or with minimally invasive techniques, over a 17-year period.
Patients were analyzed by age, gender, and causes of hypothermia and split into two groups (indoors and outdoors), according to the location where hypothermia occurred. Prognostic factors were determined by univariate method and stepwise logistic regression. The major complications were acute renal failure (43 %), aspiration pneumonia (22 %), rhabdomyolysis (22 %), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (12%). Principal comorbidities in the outdoor patients (21%) were alcohol and drug intoxication, and those in the indoor patients (79 %) were sepsis and neuropsychiatric disorders. Stepwise logistic regression identified two variables predictive of death: illness severity at admission (SAPS II > or = 40) and the location where hypothermia occurred (indoors versus outdoors).",Is hypothermia with indoor occurrence associated with a worse outcome?,"Yes. With equivalent body temperature, patients found indoors were more severely affected and died more frequently than those found outdoors.",PASS,pubmedQA

tsTGF-β1 is increased in genetic aortic syndromes including TAAD, LDS, MFS, and BAVD.
We measured tsTGF-β1 and performed sequencing of the genes FBN1, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2 in 317 consecutive patients with suspected or known genetic aortic syndrome (167 men, 150 women; mean age 43 ± 14 years). TAAD was diagnosed in 20, LDS in 20, MFS in 128, and BAVD in 30 patients, and genetic aortic syndrome was excluded in 119 patients.
Elevated tsTGF-β1 levels were associated with causative gene mutations (P = 0.008), genetic aortic syndrome (P = 0.009), and sporadic occurrence of genetic aortic syndrome (P = 0.048), whereas only genetic aortic syndrome qualified as an independent predictor of tsTGF-β1 (P = 0.001). The tsTGF-β1 levels were elevated in FBN1 and NOTCH1 mutations vs patients without mutations (both P = 0.004), and in NOTCH1 mutations vs ACTA2/MYH11 mutations (P = 0.015). Similarly, tsTGF-β1 levels were elevated in MFS (P = 0.003) and in BAVD (P = 0.006) vs patients without genetic aortic syndrome.

Cell line study.
Tumor cell growth with the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin was measured in the presence or absence of HA, anti-CD44 antibody plus HA, and other inhibitors of the PLC-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway. Ca2+ mobilization was measured with fluorescence spectrophotometry using the Ca2+ binding dye Fura/2AM.
In the absence of HA, cisplatin inhibited tumor cell growth. The addition of HA, but not HA plus anti-CD44 antibody, resulted in a 5-fold reduced ability of cisplatin to cause HNSCC cell death, suggesting that HA can promote CD44-dependent cisplatin resistance. Fluorescence spectrophotometry demonstrated that HA can promote CD44-dependent Ca2+ mobilization in HNSCC. On the other hand, the presence of U73122, a PLC inhibitor, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor inhibitor, eliminated HA-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and HA-mediated cisplatin resistance in these cell lines.",Does hyaluronan-CD44 promote phospholipase C-mediated Ca2+ signaling and cisplatin resistance in head and neck cancer?,"Yes. Our results indicate that HA-CD44 signaling influences cisplatin sensitivity in HNSCC cell growth.

Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy.
The study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data (36 +/- 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning.
Bile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31/228) of patients and was more common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% (33/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5/31) of the patients with BDS (p = 0.99). Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group.

Surgery was used in 42.9% (2057 of 4799) of cT2N0 patients. Of 1599 esophagectomy patients for whom treatment timing was recorded, induction therapy was used in 44.1% (688). Pretreatment staging was proven accurate in only 26.7% of patients (210 of 786) who underwent initial surgery without induction treatment and had complete pathologic data available: 41.6% (n = 327) were upstaged and 31.7% (n = 249) were downstaged. Adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiation therapy) was given to 50.2% of patients treated initially with surgery who were found after resection to have nodal disease. There was no significant difference in long-term survival between strategies of primary surgery and induction therapy followed by surgery (median 41.1 versus 41.9 months, p = 0.51).

The aims of the present study were to investigate whether t-PA gene expression is regulated by retinoids and the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in human astrocytes, and to study whether t-PA is stored and subject to regulated release from these cells, as with endothelial cells.
Native human astrocytes were treated with RA and/or PMA. mRNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR and protein secretion determined by ELISA. Intracellular t-PA immunoreactivity in astrocytes was examined by immunocyto- and histochemistry.
RA and/or PMA induced a time-dependent increase in t-PA mRNA and protein levels in astrocytes, reaching 10-fold after combined treatment. This was associated with increased amounts of t-PA storage in intracellular granular structures. Both forskolin and histamine induced regulated release of t-PA.

Genetic regions associated with susceptibility to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis were identified in a genome-wide linkage analysis in F2 progeny of colitis-susceptible SJL/J and -resistant C57BL/6 mice. An immunogenetic approach was then used to further study the pathophysiologic role of one of the identified loci.
We identified susceptibility loci on chromosomes 9 (Tnbs1) and 11 (Tnbs2). Tnbs2 harbors the interleukin (IL)-12 p40 gene, a likely candidate gene because IL-12 is a known central mediator for both experimental colitis and human Crohn's disease. We therefore tested the ability of colitis-susceptible and -resistant strains to mount IL-12 responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a strong inducer of IL-12 that is abundantly present in the intestine. We observed a remarkably higher serum IL-12 response to LPS in susceptible SJL/J mice.

We used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess hip, spine and ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD) (n=161), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality (n=161), and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine (L(1)-L(3)) and mid-femur (n=111). Current (>50+ years) and past hours of sport and leisure activity participation during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50 years) were assessed by questionnaire. This information was used to calculate the total time (min) spent participating in sport and leisure activities and an osteogenic index (OI) score for each participant, which provides a measure of participation in weight-bearing activities.
Regression analysis revealed that a greater lifetime (13-50+ years) and mid-adulthood (19-50 years) OI, but not total time (min), was associated with a greater mid-femur total and cortical area, cortical bone mineral content (BMC), and the polar moment of inertia (I (p)) and heel VOS (p ranging from <0.05 to <0.01). These results were independent of age, height (or femoral length) and weight (or muscle cross-sectional area). Adolescent OI scores were not found to be significant predictors of bone structure or strength. Furthermore, no significant relationships were detected with areal or volumetric BMD at any site. Subjects were then categorized into either a high (H) or low/non-impact (L) group during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50+ years) according to their OI scores during each of these periods. Three groups were subsequently formed to reflect weight-bearing impact categories during adolescence and then adulthood: LL, HL and HH.

Death.
Grade of employment was a strong predictor of mortality before retirement. For men dying at ages 40-64 the lowest employment grade had 3.12 times the mortality of the highest grade (95% confidence interval 2.4 to 4.1). After retirement the ability of grade to predict mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal magnitude after retirement.

Depletion of PAPC could be rescued by full-length PAPC, constitutive active RhoA and by the closely related PCNS but not by classical cadherins. Also the cytoplasmic deletion mutant M-PAPC, which influences cell adhesion, does not rescue the PAPC knockdown. Interestingly, depletion of Wnt5a or Ror2 which are also expressed in the otocyst phenocopies the PAPC morphant phenotype.",Do pAPC and the Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway control the invagination of the otic placode in Xenopus?,Yes. PAPC signaling via RhoA and Wnt5a/Ror2 activity are required to keep cells aligned in apical-basal orientation during invagination of the ear placode. Since neither the cytoplasmic deletion mutant M-PAPC nor a classical cadherin is able to rescue loss of PAPC we suggest that the signaling function of the protocadherin rather than its role as modulator of cell-cell adhesion is required during invagination of the ear placode.,PASS,pubmedQA

Using data from Get With The Guidelines-Stroke with over half a million acute ischemic strokes recorded between October 2011 and March 2014 (n=540 993) from 1661 hospitals across the United States, we examined the unadjusted and adjusted associations between previous antithrombotic use and clinical outcomes.
There were 250 104 (46%) stroke patients not receiving any antithrombotic before stroke; of whom approximately one third had a documented previous vascular indication. After controlling for clinical and hospital factors, patients who were receiving antithrombotics before stroke had better outcomes than those who did not, regardless of whether a previous vascular indication was present or not: adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) were 0.82 (0.80-0.84) for in-hospital mortality, 1.18 (1.16-1.19) for home as the discharge destination, 1.15 (1.13-1.16) for independent ambulatory status at discharge, and 1.15 (1.12-1.17) for discharge modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1.",Does prior Antithrombotic Use be Associated With Favorable Mortality and Functional Outcomes in Acute Ischemic Stroke?,Yes.

The study cohort consisted of 1622 Bogalusa Heart Study participants (aged 20 to 51 years at follow-up) who had been screened at least four times during childhood (aged 4-19 years). BMI rate of change during childhood for each individual was assessed by mixed models; BMI residual standard deviation (RSD) during childhoodwas used as a measure of variability. The average follow-up period was 20.9 years.
One standard deviation increase in rate of change in BMI during childhood was associated with 1.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-1.61] kg/m(2) increase in adult BMI and 2.98 (95% CI: 2.42-3.56) cm increase in adult waist circumference, independently of childhood mean BMI. Similarly, one standard deviation increase in RSD in BMI during childhood was associated with 0.46 (95% CI: 0.23-0.69) kg/m(2) increase in adult BMI and 1.42 (95% CI: 0.82-2.02) cm increase in adult waist circumference. Odds ratio for adult obesity progressively increased from the lowest to the highest quartile of BMI rate of change or RSD during childhood (P for trend < 0.05 for both).",Are variability and rapid increase in body mass index during childhood associated with adult obesity?,Yes.

The aim of this study was to determine whether peripheral insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp is increased in patients presenting for hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
Participants were non-obese individuals without Type 2 diabetes (n=5) or obese patients with Type 2 diabetes (n=5). Patients were given 100% oxygen at 2.0 absolute atmospheres for 2 h, six sessions per week for 5 weeks.
Peripheral insulin sensitivity was increased in the whole cohort (P=0.04). Subsequent analysis revealed that this was significant at both treatment 3 (+37.3 ± 12.7%, P=0.02) and treatment 30 (+40.6 ± 12.6%, P=0.009).

1334,15922431,"To determine whether use of the digital rectal examination (DRE) results in decreased participation in prostate cancer (PCa) screening, which, in turn, would result in lower detection. Population-based PCa screening includes prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement with or without a DRE. PSA and DRE screening provide greater sensitivity than PSA alone; however, the increased participation rate resulting from PSA-alone screening may result in a greater detection rate.
We performed a survey of 13,580 healthy men undergoing PSA-only population-based screening. In addition to the basic demographic information, the survey asked whether the participant would still be willing to participate in the screening if it included a DRE. We modeled the willingness to participate to assess the effect of PSA screening versus PSA and DRE screening on the basis of previously published data and our results.
The results of our study indicated that only 78% of men would participate in screening that included both DRE and PSA. Thus, 7800 men of a theoretical population of 10,000 would participate in a screening that included both DRE and PSA. The positive screen rate (PSA > or = 4.0 ng/mL and/or abnormal DRE) would then have been 2013, with 472 PCa cases and 1540 negative biopsies. In the PSA-alone arm, all 10,000 men would have agreed to participate, and the positive screen rate (PSA > or = 4.0 ng/mL) would have been 1480, with 499 PCa cases and 980 negative biopsies. The PSA-alone arm would thus have detected 27 more cancers and performed 560 fewer negative biopsies.",Is digital rectal examination barrier to population-based prostate cancer screening?,"Yes. The results of our study have demonstrated that DRE is a significant barrier to participation in PCa screening. PSA plus DRE-based programs result in fewer cases of PCa detected, with a significant increase in negative biopsies. We, therefore, suggest that future mass screening efforts include only PSA determination and omit the DRE.",PASS,pubmedQA

In this study, we investigated the role of c-Met in melanoma biology using a novel small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU11274 and small interfering (si) RNA against the receptor.
The effects of SU11274 and c-Met siRNA were studied on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, reactive oxygen species, and intracellular signaling. c-Met mutations were examined, and the expression of c-Met and activated c-Met was studied in nevi, primary, and metastatic melanoma.
c-Met was expressed in 6:7 melanoma cell lines by immunoblotting. SU11274 inhibited cell growth in all melanoma cell lines by 85% to 98% with an IC(50) between 1 and 2.5 mumol/L and caused apoptosis (12-58%) in five out of six cell lines. siRNA against c-Met inhibited proliferation of melanoma cells by 60%. This is the first study that shows that SU11274 and siRNA induced microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and several other melanoma differentiation proteins and a morphologically differentiated phenotype. SU11274 also inhibited reactive oxygen species formation and phosphorylation of c-Met receptor, AKT and S-6 kinase by the hepatocyte growth factor. A new missense c-Met mutation N948S was identified in cell lines and R988C in tumor tissue in the juxtamembrane domain of c-Met.

1336,23800339,"We addressed the question whether live-virus challenges could alter vaccine-induced antibody (Ab) responses in vaccinated rhesus macaques (RMs) that completely resisted repeated exposures to R5-tropic simian-human immunodeficiency viruses encoding heterologous HIV clade C envelopes (SHIV-Cs).
We examined the Ab responses in aviremic RMs that had been immunized with a multi-component protein vaccine (multimeric HIV-1 gp160, HIV-1 Tat and SIV Gag-Pol particles) and compared anti-Env plasma Ab titers before and after repeated live-virus exposures. Although no viremia was ever detected in these animals, they showed significant increases in anti-gp140 Ab titers after they had encountered live SHIVs. When we investigated the dynamics of anti-Env Ab titers during the immunization and challenge phases further, we detected the expected, vaccine-induced increases of Ab responses about two weeks after the last protein immunization. Remarkably, these titers kept rising during the repeated virus challenges, although no viremia resulted. In contrast, in vaccinated RMs that were not exposed to virus, anti-gp140 Ab titers declined after the peak seen two weeks after the last immunization. These data suggest boosting of pre-existing, vaccine-induced Ab responses as a consequence of repeated live-virus exposures. Next, we screened polyclonal plasma samples from two of the completely protected vaccinees by peptide phage display and designed a strategy that selects for recombinant phages recognized only by Abs present after - but not before - any SHIV challenge. With this ""subtractive biopanning"" approach, we isolated V3 mimotopes that were only recognized after the animals had been exposed to live virus. By detailed epitope mapping of such anti-V3 Ab responses, we showed that the challenges not only boosted pre-existing binding and neutralizing Ab titers, but also induced Abs targeting neo-antigens presented by the heterologous challenge virus.",Does live-virus exposure of vaccine-protected macaques alter the anti-HIV-1 antibody repertoire in the absence of viremia?,"Yes.

Butyrate oxidation was measured in 73 UC patients, 22 pouchitis patients, and 112 controls (95 colon, 17 ileum) by incubating biopsies with 1 mM 14C-labeled Na-butyrate and measuring the released 14CO2.
Compared with that in normal colon, butyrate oxidation was significantly impaired in endoscopically active but not in quiescent disease or uninvolved colon segments. The severity of the metabolic defect was related to histological disease activity and decreased epithelial cell height. In active pouchitis, butyrate oxidation was significantly decreased compared with that in normal ileum and excluded pouches without inflammation.

This study investigated brain response to rewards during hunger and satiated states to examine whether diminished response to reward could underlie food restriction in AN.
Using a delay discounting monetary decision task known to discriminate brain regions contributing to processing of immediate rewards and cognitive control important for decision making regarding future rewards, we compared 23 women remitted from AN (RAN group; to reduce the confounding effects of starvation) with 17 healthy comparison women (CW group). Monetary rewards were used because the rewarding value of food may be confounded by anxiety in AN.
Interactions of Group (RAN, CW) × Visit (hunger, satiety) revealed that, for the CW group, hunger significantly increased activation in reward salience circuitry (ventral striatum, dorsal caudate, anterior cingulate cortex) during processing of immediate reward, whereas satiety increased activation in cognitive control circuitry (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula) during decision making. In contrast, brain response in reward and cognitive neurocircuitry did not differ during hunger and satiety in the RAN group. A main effect of group revealed elevated response in the middle frontal gyrus for the RAN group compared with the CW group.",Does hunger motivate reward in women remitted from anorexia nervosa?,No. Women remitted from AN failed to increase activation of reward valuation circuitry when hungry and showed elevated response in cognitive control circuitry independent of metabolic state. Decreased sensitivity to the motivational drive of hunger may explain the ability of individuals with AN to restrict food when emaciated.

The selected proteins were confirmed by Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in additional samples and the function of some proteins in varioliform gastritis was analyzed by bio-method preliminarily.
We identified 21 differentially expressed proteins in varioliform gastritis, and compared them with matched normal mucosa. Eleven proteins were upregulated and ten downregulated in varioliform gastritis when compared with the same proteins in individual-matched normal gastric mucosa. These proteins are related to metabolism, oxidation, cytoskeleton, apoptosis, signal transduction and other aspects of cells. Two novel proteins, thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 (TXNDC5) upregulated in varioliform gastritis, and neuropolypeptide h3 [phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1)] downregulated in varioliform gastritis, were further investigated. Their expressions were validated by Western blotting and RT-PCR in 12 cases of varioliform gastritis which was matched with normal mucosa.

Recurrence of atrial fibrillation off-antiarrhythmic drugs was the primary outcome. Predictors of AF recurrence were evaluated by means of competing risk regression. Median follow-up was 36.7 months.
The percentage of patients in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) off-antiarrhythmic drugs did not differ between groups (Group 1-75.5%, Group 2-67.8%, p = 0.08). Duration of AF ≥ 38 months (p = 0.01), left atrial diameter ≥ 54 mm (0.001), left atrial area ≥ 33 cm(2) (p = 0.005), absence of connecting lesions (p= 0.04), and absence of right atrial ablation (p<0.001) were independently associated with high incidence of AF recurrence.

1011,24073931,"In recent years, many advances in pancreatic surgery have been achieved. Nevertheless, the rate of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic tail resection does not differ between various techniques, still reaching up to 30% in prospective multicentric studies. Taking into account contradictory results concerning the usefulness of covering resection margins after distal pancreatectomy, we sought to perform a systematic, retrospective analysis of patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy at our center.
We retrospectively analysed the data of 74 patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy between 2001 and 2011 at the community hospital in Neuss. Demographic factors, indications, postoperative complications, surgical or interventional revisions, and length of hospital stay were registered to compare the outcome of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy with coverage of the resection margins vs. patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy without coverage of the resection margins. Differences between groups were calculated using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test.
Main indications for pancreatic surgery were insulinoma (n=18, 24%), ductal adenocarcinoma (n=9, 12%), non-single-insulinoma-pancreatogenic-hypoglycemia-syndrome (NSIPHS) (n=8, 11%), and pancreatic cysts with pancreatitis (n=8, 11%). In 39 of 74 (53%) patients no postoperative complications were noted. In detail we found that 23/42 (55%) patients with coverage vs. 16/32 (50%) without coverage of the resection margins had no postoperative complications. The most common complications were pancreatic fistulas in eleven patients (15%), and postoperative bleeding in nine patients (12%). Pancreatic fistulas occurred in patients without coverage of the resection margins in 7/32 (22%) vs. 4/42 (1011%) with coverage are of the resection margins, yet without reaching statistical significance. Postoperative bleeding ensued with equal frequency in both groups (12% with coverage versus 13% without coverage of the resection margins). The reoperation rate was 8%.

In-vitro studies were conducted on effect of lead alone and lead+WRE on rat-isolated portal vein while in-vivo studies were done in three groups of 12 rats each; Group-II and III received 0.5% lead acetate and 1.0% WRE + 0.5% lead acetate, respectively, in drinking water for 12 weeks whereas group-I served as control. Adrenaline and noradrenaline levels in brain and blood were determined by HPLC assay while vascular reactivity of portal vein to lead and WRE was determined by measuring the isometric tension.
Following in-vitro exposure, lead did not alter the contractile effect of phenylephrine. In-vivo studies revealed that contractile effect of lead on portal vein was significantly potentiated and it was antagonized by prazosin (10(-7) M) and WRE (1%). WRE treatment significantly reduced elevated blood noradrenaline (37.80%) and restored noradrenaline level in brain (39.39%) in lead-exposed animals.

It is not known whether this holds true for neonates as well. Less pain would imply that opioid consumption can be reduced, which has a beneficial effect on morbidity.AIM: To evaluate potential differences in' opioid consumption between neonates undergoing thoracoscopic minimal access surgery or conventional surgery of esophageal atresia (EA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).
In this retrospective cohort study we included two controls for each MAS patient, matched on diagnosis, sex and age at surgery. Opioid dose titration was based on validated pain scores (VAS and COMFORT behaviour), applied by protocol. Cumulative opioid doses at 12, 24, 48 h and 7 days postoperatively were compared between groups with the Mann-Whitney test.
The study group consisted of 24 MAS patients (14 EA; 10 CDH). These were matched to 48 control patients (28 EA; 20 CDH). At none of the time points cumulative opioid (median in mg/kg (IQR)) doses significantly differed between MAS patients and controls, both with CDH and EA. For example at 24 h postoperative for CDH patients cumulative opioid doses were [0.84(0.61-1.83) MAS vs. 1.06(0.60-1.36) p=1.0] controls, For EApatients at 24 h the cumulative opioid doses were [0.48(0.30-0.75) MAS vs. 0.49(0.35-0.79) p=0.83] controls.

Blood samples from 194 subjects presenting with ACS, angina, or non-cardiac chest pain were analyzed for endotoxin/LPS (Limulus amebocyte lysate assay), lipid profile, troponin, and IgG antibody to P. gingivalis. Data were collected from hospital charts and dental records, and health questionnaire responses.
Subjects with ACS or angina were more likely to have poor oral care, fewer remaining teeth, and increased alveolar radiographic bone loss compared to subjects with chest pain.

The impact of Notch1 silencing by specific shRNAs on the EMT and invasion of human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells as well as xenografts was tested by western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, transwell, and immunohistochemistry assays. The effect of Slug silencing or upregulation on the EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells was analyzed, and the effect of Notch1 signaling on Slug expression was determined by the luciferase reporter assay.
The Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) and Jagged1 were expressed in breast cancer cells. Notch1 silencing reversed the spontaneous EMT process and inhibited the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and the growth of xenograft breast cancers. The expression of N1ICD was upregulated significantly by Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling activation. Moreover, Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling promoted the EMT process, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells, which were abrogated by Notch silencing. Furthermore, the N1ICD positively regulated the Slug expression by inducing Slug promoter activation. Importantly, the knockdown of Slug weakened the invasion ability of breast cancer cells and reversed the Jagged1-induced EMT process with significantly decreased expression of vimentin and increased expression of E-cadherin. In addition, Slug overexpression restored the Notch1 knockdown-suppressed EMT process.",Does notch1 signaling regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion of breast cancer in a Slug-dependent manner?,"Yes.

Arterial segments (internal diameters 206+/-4 microm, n=224) were mounted in microvascular myographs for isometric tension recordings and electrical field stimulation (EFS).
ZP120 and the endogenous NOP receptor ligand, N/OFQ, did not relax arteries contracted with noradrenaline or adenosine-triphosphate. EFS-evoked contractions were inhibited by a purinoceptor antagonist, suramin, and the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. N/OFQ inhibited, concentration-dependently, EFS-evoked contractions with a maximal effect of 52+/-3% (n=8) at 1 microM. The maximal effect of 1 microM ZP120 was lower (27+/-5%, P<0.05, n=9) than for N/OFQ. Endothelial removal or pretreatment with capsaicin did not influence the vasodilator effects of ZP120 and N/OFQ.

1039,14976655,"The aim of this study was to evaluate poststapedectomy-delayed facial palsy etiopathogenesis, risk factors, evolution, and prevention.
Seven hundred six stapedectomies performed in 580 patients were reviewed. In all patients who developed delayed facial palsy, the dates of onset and subside of facial palsy, the anatomic and pathologic predisposing factors, and a possible history for recurrent labial herpetic lesions were considered. The House-Brackmann (H-B) grading system was used to evaluate the facial function. Virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM antibodies against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 3 weeks after the onset of the paralysis. The results were compared with a control group without a history of recurrent herpes labialis.
Poststapedectomy facial palsy developed in 7 out of 706 procedures. All 7 patients referred a history of recurrent labial herpetic lesions. One patient showed a facial palsy H-B grade II, 2 a grade III, and 3 a grade IV. After acyclovir therapy, 6 subjects recovered completely, whereas 1 maintained an H-B grade II. An increased IgG antibody titer was found in 6 of the patients with delayed facial palsy and in 1 out of 7 controls. Mean IgG titer was 1:14,050 in the subjects with delayed facial palsy and 1:2,300 in controls (P<.001).",Delayed peripheral facial palsy in the stapes surgery: can it be prevented?,"Yes.

1451,26774179,"The combination of β-blockers and band ligation is the standard approach to prevent variceal rebleeding, but bleeding recurs and mortality is high. The lipid-lowering drug simvastatin decreases portal pressure, improves hepatocellular function, and might reduce liver fibrosis. We assessed whether adding simvastatin to standard therapy could reduce rebleeding and death after variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.
We performed a multicenter, double-blind, parallel trial of 158 patients with cirrhosis receiving standard prophylaxis to prevent rebleeding (a β-blocker and band ligation) in Spain from October 2010 through October 2013. Within 10 days of bleeding, subjects were randomly assigned, but stratified by Child-Pugh class of A or B vs C, to groups given simvastatin (20 mg/d the first 15 days, 40 mg/d thereafter; n = 69) or placebo (n = 78). Patients were followed for as long as 24 months. The primary end point was a composite of rebleeding and death, and main secondary end points were the individual components of the composite (death and rebleeding).
The primary end point was met by 30 of 78 patients in the placebo group and 22 of 69 in the simvastatin group (P = .423).

Highest level of education may be a surrogate for socioeconomic status, but the degree to which this is associated with patient-reported outcomes after THA is not known.
We investigated the national Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register for the association of education attainment on patient-reported outcomes 1 year after THA; specifically, we evaluated level of education attainment against health-related quality of life (HRQoL), pain reduction, and satisfaction with treatment 1 year after THA.
All THAs for osteoarthritis performed from 2005 through 2007 with complete patient-reported outcome measures (representing 49% of the THAs performed for this diagnosis) were selected from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register. These cases were merged with national databases containing education attainment, marital status, and comorbidities (n = 11,464; mean age of patients, 64 years). The patient-reported outcome measure protocol included the HRQoL measure EuroQol five-dimension scale (EQ-5D), a VAS for pain, the Charnley classification survey, and a VAS addressing THA satisfaction. Linear regression analyses determined the association of preoperative patient factors with patient-reported outcomes.
High education attainment was associated with higher HRQoL (EQ-5D index ß(high) = 0.03 ± 0.01; EQ VAS ß(high) = 2.6 ± 0.5) after THA, whereas those with low and medium education were at risk for lower HRQoL. High education was associated with less pain after treatment (ß(high) = -3.3 ± 0.05). Individuals with low or medium education were at risk for less satisfaction with THA (p < 0.001).",Is education attainment associated with patient-reported outcomes : findings from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register?,"Yes. Our results suggest clinicians should support patients with low and medium education to a greater extent.

Seven human cervical carcinoma cell lines (HeLa, SKG-I, SKG-IIIb, QG-U, Caski, SiHa and C33A) were examined for basal levels of GRP94 protein by western blotting analysis. Sensitivity to X-ray irradiation of these cell lines was determined with a colony survival assay. The suppression of GRP94 expression was performed using specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) in HeLa and Caski cells.
HeLa cells and QG-U cells, with higher basal levels of GRP94, exhibited a low sensitivity to X-ray cell killing. In HeLa cells, the sensitivity increased when protein GRP94 levels were reduced by specific siRNA transfection. However, a reduction in GRP94 protein had little effect on the X-ray sensitivity of Caski cells, which expressed low basal GRP94 protein levels but showed a low sensitivity to X-rays.",Is increased expression of GRP94 protein associated with decreased sensitivity to X-rays in cervical cancer cell lines?,"Yes. High basal protein levels of GRP94 were correlated with a modest decrease in sensitivity to X-ray cell death in some cervical cancer cell lines.

This randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of fexofenadine in children with seasonal allergic rhinitis.
This study was conducted at 148 centers in 15 countries. Nine hundred thirty-five children (aged 6-11 years) were randomized and treated with either fexofenadine HCl 30 mg (n = 464) or placebo (n = 471) tablets twice a day for 14 days. Individual symptoms (sneezing; rhinorrhea; itchy nose, mouth, throat, and/or ears; itchy, watery, and/or red eyes; and nasal congestion) were assessed at baseline and then daily at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM (+/-1 hour) during the double-blind treatment period. Each total symptom score was the sum of all symptoms, excluding nasal congestion. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in the average of the daily 12-hour evening reflective total symptom scores throughout the double-blind treatment. Safety was evaluated from adverse-event reporting, vital signs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory data at screening and study end point.
Fexofenadine was significantly superior to placebo in the primary efficacy analysis (P </=.0001).

Numbers and types of adverse events were roughly equivalent among groups, although enrollment was limited, so it was not clear how rare adverse events might affect overall outcomes in practice. We sought to define the frequency at which a rare adverse event would have to occur for the risks of combination therapy to outweigh the benefits of treatment.
We constructed a decision model to compare the risks and benefits of IFX/AZA with IFX monotherapy. Model parameters were taken from SONIC and other published literature. The base-case analysis was patients with active Crohn's disease who are naïve to both medications (similar to those in SONIC) who were treated for 1 year. We used sensitivity analyses to determine the thresholds at which the risks of side effects from IFX/AZA outweigh its benefits.
During 1 year, the benefits of IFX/AZA would outweigh the risks, unless serious infections occurred in 20% or more of the population or lymphoma in 3.9% or more.

Differences in the capacities of HDL subfractions to remove cellular cholesterol may explain variable correlations between HDL-cholesterol and cardiovascular risk and inform future targets for HDL-related therapies. The ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) facilitates cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I, but the majority of apolipoprotein A-I in the circulation is transported in a lipidated state and ABCA1-dependent efflux to individual HDL subfractions has not been systematically studied.
Our aims were to determine which HDL particle subfractions are most efficient in mediating cellular cholesterol efflux from foam cell macrophages and to identify the cellular cholesterol transporters involved in this process.
We used reconstituted HDL particles of defined size and composition, isolated subfractions of human plasma HDL, cell lines stably expressing ABCA1 or ABCG1, and both mouse and human macrophages in which ABCA1 or ABCG1 expression was deleted. We show that ABCA1 is the major mediator of macrophage cholesterol efflux to HDL, demonstrating most marked efficiency with small, dense HDL subfractions (HDL3b and HDL3c). ABCG1 has a lesser role in cholesterol efflux and a negligible role in efflux to HDL3b and HDL3c subfractions.",Is hDL particle size a critical determinant of ABCA1-mediated macrophage cellular cholesterol export?,"Yes.

1304,11509232,"During Drosophila embryogenesis, Jun kinase (JNK) signaling has been shown to play a key role in regulating the morphogenetic process of dorsal closure, which also serves as a model for epithelial sheet fusion during wound repair. During dorsal closure the JNK signaling cascade in the dorsal-most (leading edge) cells of the epidermis activates the AP-1 transcription factor comprised of DJUN and DFOS that, in turn, upregulates the expression of the dpp gene. DPP is a secreted morphogen that signals lateral epidermal cells to elongate along the dorsoventral axis. The leading edge cells contact the peripheral cells of a monolayer extraembryonic epithelium, the amnioserosa, which lies on the dorsal side of the embryo. Focal complexes are present at the dorsal-most membrane of the leading edge cells, where they contact the amnioserosa.
We show that the JNK signaling cascade is initially active in both the amnioserosa and the leading edge of the epidermis. JNK signaling is downregulated in the amnioserosa, but not in the leading edge, prior to dorsal closure. The subcellular localization of DFOS and DJUN is responsive to JNK signaling in the amnioserosa: JNK activation results in nuclear localization of DFOS and DJUN; the downregulation of JNK signaling results in the relocalization of DFOS and DJUN to the cytoplasm. The HINDSIGHT (HNT) Zn-finger protein and the PUCKERED (PUC) JNK phosphatase are essential for downregulation of the JNK cascade in the amnioserosa. Persistent JNK activity in the amnioserosa leads to defective focal complexes in the adjacent leading edge cells and to the failure of dorsal closure.",Is downregulation of Jun kinase signaling in the amnioserosa essential for dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo?,"Yes. Focal complexes are assembled at the boundary between high and low JNK activity. In the absence of focal complexes, miscommunication between the amnioserosa and the leading edge may lead to a premature ""stop"" signal that halts dorsalward migration of the leading edge.

As most opioid agonists are selective but not specific, a broad spectrum of behaviours due to activation of different opioid receptors is expected. In this study, we examine whether other opioid receptor systems influenced KOP-mediated antinociception.
We used a tail withdrawal assay in C57Bl/6 mice to assay the antinociceptive effect of systemically administered opioid agonists with varying selectivity at KOP receptors. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to analyse the interactions of the other opioid receptors in modulating KOP-mediated antinociception.
Etorphine, a potent agonist at all four opioid receptors, was not anti-nociceptive in MOP knockout (KO) mice, although etorphine is an efficacious KOP receptor agonist and specific KOP receptor agonists remain analgesic in MOP KO mice. As KOP receptor agonists are aversive, we considered KOP-mediated antinociception might be a form of stress-induced analgesia that is blocked by the anxiolytic effects of DOP receptor agonists. In support of this hypothesis, pretreatment with the DOP antagonist, naltrindole (10 mg·kg(-1) ), unmasked etorphine (3 mg·kg(-1) ) antinociception in MOP KO mice. Further, in wild-type mice, KOP-mediated antinociception by systemic U50,488H (10 mg·kg(-1) ) was blocked by pretreatment with the DOP agonist SNC80 (5 mg·kg(-1) ) and diazepam (1 mg·kg(-1) ).",Is anti-nociception mediated by a κ opioid receptor agonist blocked by a δ receptor agonist?,"Yes.

AIA rats were treated with nor-NOHA (40 mg/kg/d, ip) for 21 days after the onset of arthritis. A group of untreated AIA rats and a group of healthy rats served as controls. ED was assessed by the vasodilatory effect of acetylcholine (Ach) on aortic rings. The role of superoxide anions, prostanoids, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway was studied. Plasma levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by ELISA kits. Arthritis severity was estimated by a clinical, radiological and histological analysis.
Nor-NOHA treatment fully restored the aortic response to Ach to that of healthy controls. The results showed that this beneficial effect is mediated by an increase in NOS activity and EDHF and reduced superoxide anion production as well as a decrease in the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, thromboxane and prostacyclins synthases.

Colitis was induced in C57/Bl6 mice by administration of dextran sodium sulfate, and mice were given 10(8) bacteria for 15 consecutive days by gavage. Stool/tissue samples were collected and analyzed.
LF82-ΔchiA had significantly less adhesion to IEC lines than LF82. Complementation of LF82-ΔchiA with the LF82 chiA gene, but not chiA from nonpathogenic (K12) E coli, increased adhesion. We identified 5 specific polymorphisms in the chitin-binding domain of LF82 chiA (at amino acids 362, 370, 378, 388, and 548) that differ from chiA of K12 and were required for LF82 to interact directly with IECs. This interaction was mediated by an N-glycosylated asparagine in chitinase 3-like-1 (amino acid 68) on IECs. Mice infected with LF82, or LF82-ΔchiA complemented with LF82 chiA, developed more severe colitis after administration of dextran sodium sulfate than mice infected with LF82-ΔchiA or LF82 that expressed mutant forms of chiA.",Do chitin-binding domains of Escherichia coli ChiA mediate interactions with intestinal epithelial cells in mice with colitis?,Yes. AIEC adheres to an N-glycosylated chitinase 3-like-1 on IECs via the chitin-binding domain of chiA. This mechanism promotes the pathogenic effects of AIEC in mice with colitis.,PASS,pubmedQA

This study examined the association between Type D personality, coping, and perceived health among Chinese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).
One hundred seventeen CHD patients completed the assessments on Type D personality, coping, perceived severity of CHD, and morale.
There was no difference on severity of coronary artery stenosis between Type D and non-Type D patients. Compared to the non-Type D patients, the Type D patients perceived higher severity of CHD (5.31 ± 2.41 versus 4.45 ± 2.17, p < 0.05) and lower morale (12.67 ± 4.71 versus 15.00 ± 4.43, p < 0.05), and used less confrontation (16.90 ± 5.39 versus 20.88 ± 4.95, p < 0.001) and more acceptance-resignation coping (10.16 ± 3.50 versus 8.35 ± 3.48, p < 0.05).

Randomized study.
Postoperative cardiac recovery unit, University Hospital.
Sixty patients with ischemic heart disease scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting ± aortic valve replacement.
Randomized to either remifentanil or sufentanil anesthesia as basis opioid. Postoperative pain management consisted of morphine in both groups.
Cognitive functioning evaluated preoperatively and on the 1st, 4th, and 30th postoperative day using the cognitive test from the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Hospital. Perioperative invasive hemodynamics and the quality of recovery was evaluated by means of invasive measurements and an intensive care unit discharge score.
No difference between opioids in POCD at any time. A negative correlation was found between preoperative cognitive function and POCD on the first postoperative day (r=-0.47; P=.0002). The fraction of patients with POCD on the first postoperative day was statistically greater in patients with more than 15minutes of Svo2 <60 (P=.037; χ(2) test). Among patients with postoperative ventilation time exceeding 300minutes, more patients had POCD on postoperative day 4 (P=.002).",Is ultrashort acting remifentanil superior to long-acting sufentanil in preserving cognitive function-a randomized study?,"No. We could not demonstrate differences in POCD between remifentanil and sufentanil based anaesthesia, but in general, the fraction of patients with POCD seemed smaller than previously reported.

Cross-sectional analyses were conducted on complete data from the last wave of the YouRAction evaluation trial. Adolescents (n = 852) completed a questionnaire asking for sports participation, perceived NSC and demographics. Ecometric methods were used to aggregate perceived NSC to zip code level. Availability of sports facilities and parks was assessed by means of geographic information systems within the zip-code area and within a 1600 meter buffer. Multilevel logistic regression analyses, with neighborhood and individual as levels, were conducted to examine associations between physical and social environmental factors and leisure time sports participation. Simple slopes analysis was conducted to decompose interaction effects.
NSC was significantly associated with sports participation (OR: 3.51 (95%CI: 1.18;10.41)) after adjustment for potential confounders. Availability of sports facilities and availability of parks were not associated with sports participation. A significant interaction between NSC and density of parks within the neighbourhood area (OR: 1.22 (90%CI: 1.01;1.34)) was found. Decomposition of the interaction term showed that adolescents were most likely to engage in leisure time sports when both availability of parks and NSC were highest.",Are neighbourhood social capital and availability of sports facilities related to sports participation among Dutch adolescents?,"Maybe. The results of this study indicate that leisure time sports participation is associated with levels of NSC, but not with availability of parks or sports facilities. In addition, NSC and availability of parks in the zip code area interacted in such a way that leisure time sports participation is most likely among adolescents living in zip code areas with higher levels of NSC, and higher availability of parks. Hence, availability of parks appears only to be important for leisure time sports participation when NSC is high.",PASS,pubmedQA

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effect of a TLR2 agonist on neonatal brain development.
Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) once a day from postnatal day (PND) 3 to PND11 with endotoxin-free saline, a TLR2 agonist Pam(3)CSK(4) (5 mg/kg) or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.3 mg/kg). Pups were sacrificed at PND12 or PND53 and brain, spleen and liver were collected and weighed. Brain sections were stained for brain injury markers. Long-term effects on memory function were assessed using the Trace Fear Conditioning test at PND50. After 9 days of Pam(3)CSK(4) administration, we found a decreased volume of cerebral gray matter, white matter in the forebrain and cerebellar molecular layer that was accompanied by an increase in spleen and liver weight at PND12. Such effects were not observed in Pam3CSK4-treated TLR 2-deficient mice. Pam3CSK4-treated mice also displayed decreased hippocampus neuronal density, and increased cerebral microglia density, while there was no effect on caspase-3 or general cell proliferation at PND12. Significantly elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-6, KC, and MCP-1 were detected after the first Pam3CSK4 injection in brain homogenates of PND3 mice.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) have shown promising antitumor activities against preclinical models of pancreatic cancer, either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we sought to identify clinically relevant histone deacetylases (HDACs) to guide the selection of HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) tailored to the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
HDAC expression in seven pancreatic cancer cell lines and normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells was determined by Western blotting. Antitumor interactions between class I- and class II-selective HDACIs were determined by MTT assays and standard isobologram/CompuSyn software analyses. The effects of HDACIs on cell death, apoptosis and cell cycle progression, and histone H4, alpha-tubulin, p21, and γH2AX levels were determined by colony formation assays, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blotting, respectively.
The majority of classes I and II HDACs were detected in the pancreatic cancer cell lines, albeit at variable levels. Treatments with MGCD0103 (a class I-selective HDACI) resulted in dose-dependent growth arrest, cell death/apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, accompanied by induction of p21 and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In contrast, MC1568 (a class IIa-selective HDACI) or Tubastatin A (a HDAC6-selective inhibitor) showed minimal effects. When combined simultaneously, MC1568 significantly enhanced MGCD0103-induced growth arrest, cell death/apoptosis, and G2/M cell cycle arrest, while Tubastatin A only synergistically enhanced MGCD0103-induced growth arrest. Although MC1568 or Tubastatin A alone had no obvious effects on DNA DSBs and p21 expression, their combination with MGCD0103 resulted in cooperative induction of p21 in the cells.",Are class I and class II histone deacetylases potential therapeutic targets for treating pancreatic cancer?,"Yes.

The study was based on 1878 men (aged 25-64 years) who participated in the first MONICA Augsburg survey 1984/1985, and who were free of coronary heart disease at baseline. Up to 2002 a total of 150 incident acute coronary events occurred. Baseline levels of GGT were higher in men who experienced an event than in event-free men (28.4+/-2.0 units/l versus 22.4+/-2.1 units/l, p 0.0002). GGT was highly correlated with other cardiovascular risk factors. In a Cox proportional hazards model after age adjustment hazard ratios (HR) for incident myocardial infarction across GGT quartiles (<13, 13 to <20, 20 to <35, and >/=35 units/l) were 1.0, 1.84, 2.02, and 3.08 (p for trend 0.0001). Further adjustment for hypertension, TC/HDL ratio, diabetes, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, education years and BMI attenuated the association; comparing the highest versus lowest quartile of GGT the HR for a first-ever coronary event was then 2.34 (95% CI, 1.23-4.44).",Is serum gamma-glutamyltransferase a predictor of incident coronary events in apparently healthy men from the general population?,"Yes.

Since no clinical or laboratory tests are available to predict response to anti-TNF therapies, great need exists for predictive biomarkers.
Here we present a multi-step proteomics approach using arthritis antigen arrays, a multiplex cytokine assay, and conventional ELISA, with the objective to identify a biomarker signature in three ethnically diverse cohorts of RA patients treated with the anti-TNF therapy etanercept.

CB1- and CB2-specific mRNA of primary human peripheral blood T cells and cells of the human T cell line Jurkat was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in response to CD3/28. Using the decoy oligonucleotide approach, transcription factors involved in the regulation were determined. A promoter analysis was performed using transient transfection of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene constructs in Jurkat cells.
Activation of human T cells caused an induction of CB1 mRNA expression in primary human T cells (8-fold) and Jurkat cells (29-fold). In contrast, CB2 transcription was not regulated. The CD3/28-mediated upregulation of CB1 involves the transcription factors AP-1, NF kappaB and NFAT.

Recently, we reported that CDX1 is hypermethylated in the human preeclampsia placenta. However, whether CDX1 participates in trophoblast invasion has not been clearly elucidated.
We investigated the function of CDX1 in the extravillous trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo using stable transfection of CDX1. Using a CDX1 stable transfected cell line, we determined the cell invasion using a QCM ECMatrix 24-well kit. The cell viability was detected using an MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting analyses were performed to examine the changes in the expression of downstream target genes and proteins. To disrupt PI3K/AKT signaling, we used the PI3K inhibitor perifosine.
Cell invasion assays demonstrated that CDX1 restricts trophoblast cell invasiveness. In contrast, quantification of cumulative cell numbers revealed that CDX1 did not affect cell proliferation. Western blotting analysis and quantitative real time PCR demonstrated that MMP-9 expression was reduced, whereas TIMP-1 expression was increased in CDX1-overexpressed cells. However, overexpression of CDX1 did not affect PI3K/AKT signaling in HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells.

Patients with historic modified Rankin Scale > 2 and those under anticoagulant treatment or with multiple ICH were excluded. The following parameters were analyzed in 194 consecutive patients: age, gender, past history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, past history of ischemic stroke, presence of ischemic heart disease or cardioembolic disease, current antiplatelet treatment, current alcohol overuse, smoking, Glasgow Coma Scale score (GSS) at admission, volume and location (deep or lobar) of ICH, ventricular extension, glycemia and temperature at admission, and leukoaraiosis. We correlated these data with the 30-day mortality identifying the independent predictors by logistic regression analysis.
Factors independently associated with 30-day mortality were: age, Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission, ICH volume, ventricular extension, glucose level at admission, and previous antiplatelet use.",Is previous antiplatelet therapy an independent predictor of 30-day mortality after spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage?,"Yes. Apart from the classical outcome predictors, the previous use of antiplatelet agents and the glucose value at admission are independent predictors of 30-day mortality in patients suffering a supratentorial ICH.",PASS,pubmedQA

Forty patients and 20 asymptomatic volunteers underwent a standardized interview, physical examination, and static and dynamic articular ultrasound. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated using magnetic resonance as the reference test.
A total of 120 temporomandibular joints were examined. Based on our findings, the presence of articular sounds and physical signs are often insufficient to detect disk displacement. Imaging by static and dynamic high-resolution ultrasound demonstrates considerably lower sensitivity when compared with magnetic resonance. Some of the technical difficulties resulted from a limited access because of the presence of surrounding bone structures.",Internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint: is there still a place for ultrasound?,No. The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.,PASS,pubmedQA
1322,23726316,"To determine the effects in adult offspring of maternal exposure to stress and alcohol during pregnancy, we imaged striatal and midbrain dopamine transporter (DAT) binding by positron emission tomography in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We also evaluated the relationship between DAT binding and behavioral responses previously found to relate to dopamine D2 receptor density (responsivity to tactile stimuli, performance on a learning task, and behavior during a learning task).
Subjects were adult offspring derived from a 2 × 2 experiment in which pregnant monkeys were randomly assigned to control, daily mild stress exposure (acoustic startle), voluntary consumption of moderate-level alcohol, or both daily stress and alcohol. Adult offspring (n = 38) were imaged by positron emission tomography with the DAT ligand [(18)F]2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-fluoroethyl)-nortropane ([(18)F]FECNT).
Results showed that prenatal stress yielded an overall increase of 15% in [(18)F]FECNT binding in the striatum (p = .016), 17% greater binding in the putamen (p = .012), and 13% greater binding in the head of the caudate (p = .028) relative to animals not exposed to prenatal stress. Striatal [(18)F]FECNT binding correlated negatively with habituation to repeated tactile stimulation and positively with tactile responsivity. There were no significant effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on [(18)F]FECNT binding.",Does prenatal stress induce increased striatal dopamine transporter binding in adult nonhuman primates?,"Yes. Maternal exposure to mild daily stress during pregnancy yielded increases in striatal DAT availability that were apparent in adult offspring and were associated with behavioral characteristics reflecting tactile hyperresponsivity, a condition associated with problem behaviors in children.",PASS,pubmedQA
1332,24449823,"TGF-β promotes tumor invasion and metastasis by inducing an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the underlying mechanisms causing this are not entirely clear. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) have been shown to play important regulatory roles in cancer progression. The lncRNA malat1 (metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is a critical regulator of the metastasis phenotype of lung cancer cells.
We, therefore, investigated whether TGF-β regulates malat1 expression to promote tumor metastasis of bladder cancer. The expression levels of malat1 and EMT markers were assayed in specimens of bladder cancer. The role of malat1 in regulating bladder cancer metastasis was evaluated in cell and animal models.
TGF-β induces malat1 expression and EMT in bladder cancer cells. malat1 overexpression is significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with bladder cancer. malat1 and E-cadherin expression is negatively correlated in vitro and in vivo. malat1 knockdown inhibits TGF-β-induced EMT. malat1 is associated with suppressor of zeste 12 (suz12), and this association results in decrease of E-cadherin expression and increase of N-cadherin and fibronectin expression. Furthermore, targeted inhibition of malat1 or suz12 suppresses the migratory and invasive properties induced by TGF-β. Finally, we demonstrated that malat1 or suz12 knockdown inhibits tumor metastasis in animal models.",Does tGF-β-induced upregulation of malat1 promote bladder cancer metastasis by associating with suz12?,"Yes. These data suggest that malat1 is an important mediator of TGF-β-induced EMT, and suggest that malat1 inhibition may represent a promising therapeutic option for suppressing bladder cancer progression.",PASS,pubmedQA

Our goal was to determine whether the above factors are contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection.
Between 1992 and 1996, 46 laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections were attempted. Fourteen patients had an abscess or phlegmon treated with bowel rest before operation (group I), 10 patients had recurrent Crohn's disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis (group II), and 22 patients had no previous operation and no phlegmon or abscess associated with their disease (group III). These groups were compared with each other and with 70 consecutive open ileocolic resections for Crohn's disease during the same time period (group IV).
Operative blood loss and time were greater in group IV than in groups I, II, and III (245 versus 151, 131, and 195 ml, respectively, and 202 versus 152, 144, and 139 minutes, respectively). Conversion to open procedure occurred in 5 patients (group I, 1 [7%]; group II, 2 [20%]; group III, 2 [9%]). Morbidity was highest in group IV (21% versus 0%, 10%, and 10%, respectively).

To identify the mucosal factors associated with asthma comorbidity, we analyzed the inflammatory patterns of nasal polyps.
Nasal polyps from 70 Belgian patients, 34% with asthma, were analyzed for type of inflammation, T-cell cytokines, and IgE antibodies to Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins. The same investigations were repeated in 93 Chinese patients with polyps, a group with a low asthma comorbidity rate (8%).
In Belgian patients with polyps, 54% of samples showed eosinophilic inflammation. A classification tree evaluation identified IL-5 as the main positive determinant. Enterotoxin IgE in tissue (37%) was associated with significantly increased total IgE and eosinophil cationic protein concentrations. Expression of enterotoxin IgE, total IgE at greater than 1,442 kU/L, and eosinophil cationic protein at greater than 17,109 μg/L in samples with a total IgE concentration of greater than 246 kU/L significantly predicted asthma (odds ratio, 5.8-13). Only 7.5% of the samples from Chinese patients with polyps showed eosinophilic inflammation. IL-5 was confirmed as a positive determinant of eosinophilic inflammation, and enterotoxin IgE in tissue (17% of patients) was associated with significantly increased total IgE and eosinophil cationic protein concentrations. The expression of IL-5 or total IgE at greater than 790 kU/L in samples with an IL-5 concentration of greater than 194 pg/mL significantly predicted comorbid asthma (odds ratio, 17.2-96).",Is presence of IL-5 protein and IgE antibodies to staphylococcal enterotoxins in nasal polyps associated with comorbid asthma?,Yes.

Twenty-three patients with organized glomerular Ig deposits were classified into two groups based on the fibrillar or microtubular ultrastructural appearance of the deposits. Kidney biopsy samples were studied by immunofluorescence microscopy, using anti-light chain conjugates (all cases) and anti-IgG subclass conjugates (13 patients). In each group, we studied clinicopathological features, associated monoclonal gammapathy (detected by immunoelectrophoresis and/or immunoblot) or B-cell lymphoproliferative disease, effects of chemotherapy and long-term renal outcome.
In 14 IT/MTGN and 9 FGN patients, clinical symptoms [hypertension, nephrotic syndrome (NS) and hematuria] and the mean diameters of the substructures were similar. In 13 IT/MTGN patients, glomerular (IgG1, 2 or 3) deposits were monotypic (kappa, 7 cases; lambda, 6 cases). Glomerular deposits were associated with a monoclonal Ig of the same isotype in eight patients, detected in the serum (5 cases), and/or in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes (4 cases), and with lymphoproliferative disease in seven patients. The ultrastructural features of monoclonal Ig inclusions in lymphocytes were similar to those of glomerular microtubular deposits. In contrast, none of the FGN patients presented lymphoplasmocytic proliferation or paraproteinemia. Glomerular Ig deposits were polyclonal in eight cases and contained IgG4 in all three cases studied. Although patient and renal survival did not differ significantly between the two groups, chemotherapy led to remission of NS in ten IT/MTGN patients, with parallel improvement in hematological parameters.",Are fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid ( microtubular ) glomerulopathy associated with distinct immunologic features?,Yes.

Our aim was to investigate in the general child population (i.e., irrespective of genetic risk for type 1 diabetes) whether mothers' experiences of serious life events, such as divorce and violence, were associated with diabetes-related autoimmunity in their children at age 2.5 years.
The study cohort was comprised of the first 5,986 consecutive children and their families from the prospective population-based All Babies in Southeast Sweden project for whom 2.5-year study data were available. Data were drawn from parental questionnaires that included questions about experiences of serious life events and the blood samples taken from the children when the children were age 2.5 years. The blood samples were analyzed for diabetes-related autoantibodies against tyrosine phosphatase and GAD.
Mothers' experiences of divorce (odds ratio 3.6, 95% CI 1.4-9.6, P < 0.05) and violence (2.9, 1.0-7.8, P < 0.05) were associated with diabetes-related autoimmunity in the children, independent of a family history of type 1 diabetes.",Do mothers ' experiences of serious life events increase the risk of diabetes-related autoimmunity in their children?,"Yes.

Whole blood was analysed for the white cell count, neutrophil count, and for neutrophil CD11b expression.
The white cell count and neutrophil counts increased after aortic clamp release. Neutrophil expression of CD11b was significantly higher in the femoral vein than the portal vein and systemic circulation during ischaemia [P=0.001 (FV vs. PV), P=0.017 (FV vs. systemic)] and reperfusion [P=0.001 (FV vs. PV), P=0.013 (FV vs. systemic)].

We aimed to evaluate the role of its negative regulators, miR-1 and miR-199a*, and its transcriptional activator, the metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1), in controlling MET expression in human colon cancer samples.
The expression of MET, miR-1, miR-199a*, and MACC1 was evaluated by real-time PCR in 52 matched pairs of colorectal cancers and nontumoral surrounding tissues. The biological role of miR-1 in controlling MET expression and biological activity was assessed in colon cancer cells either by its forced expression or by AntagomiR-mediated inhibition.
MiR-1 was downregulated in 84.6% of the tumors and its decrease significantly correlated with MET overexpression, particularly in metastatic tumors. We found that concurrent MACC1 upregulation and miR-1 downregulation are required to elicit the highest increase of MET expression. Consistent with a suppressive role of miR-1, its forced in vitro expression in colon cancer cells reduced MET levels and impaired MET-induced invasive growth. Finally, we identified a feedback loop between miR-1 and MET, resulting in their mutual regulation.",Does miR-1 downregulation cooperate with MACC1 in promoting MET overexpression in human colon cancer?,Yes. This study identifies an oncosuppressive role of miR-1 in colorectal cancer in which it acts by controlling MET expression through a feedback loop.

A total of 117 patients with AIH (mean age 18.6 [4-69] years) were evaluated and tested for autoantibodies at disease onset and successively (mean 3.2 [2-6] times) after a mean follow-up evaluation of 70 [20-185] months. Antismooth muscle (ASMA), antiliver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1), antiliver cytosol type 1 (anti-LC1), antimitochondrial, antinuclear (ANA), and antiactin antibodies (AAA) were determined at disease onset and 379 other times during the follow-up evaluation through indirect immunofluorescence in rodent tissues, HEp-2 cells, and human fibroblasts. Anti-SLA/LP were assessed 45 times in the follow-up evaluation of 19 patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Upon admission, AIH types 1 and 2 were observed in 95 and 17 patients, respectively. Five subjects had AIH with anti-SLA/LP as the sole markers. Patients initially negative for AAA did not develop these antibodies thereafter. ANA were detected de novo in six and three subjects with AIH types 1 and 2, respectively. After treatment, only ASMA (>1:80) and AAA (>1:40) were significantly associated with biochemical (76.9% and 79.8%) and histological features (100% and 100%) of disease activity (P < 0.001).",Are antismooth muscle and antiactin antibodies indirect markers of histological and biochemical activity of autoimmune hepatitis?,"Yes.

Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs.
Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals.
Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV.

We sought to determine whether CCL17 induces CCR4-dependent CGRP synthesis and secretion by human airway epithelial cells.
Human airway epithelial cell lines (BEAS-2B and A549) and human primary airway cells were cultured with CCL17 or various other cytokines, and CGRP expression was measured by using RT-PCR, quantitative immunofluorescence, and enzyme immunoassay. CCR4 expression was determined in cultured cells by using flow cytometry and in bronchial biopsy specimens by using immunohistochemistry.
CCL17 induced a several thousand-fold increase in CGRP mRNA expression and released peptide product from BEAS-2B and A549 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Concentration-dependent CCL17-induced release of CGRP by primary human airway epithelial cells was also observed. Under comparable conditions, CCL17 induced greater CGRP release from BEAS-2B cells than either IL-13, a cytokine mixture (TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IL-1), or CCL22. CCR4 was expressed by BEAS-2B and A549 cells and internalized after ligation with CCL17. CCL17-induced CGRP release was inhibited by a specific anti-CCR4 blocking antibody.

To improve the long-term quality of life after BCT of breast cancer patients, the correlation of volumetric breast density (VBD) and cosmetic outcome at the late stage after BCT was evaluated.
Breast volume, fibroglandular tissue volume, adipose tissue volume, and VBD were calculated on mammography using image analysis software (Volpara(®)) in 151 patients with BCT. Furthermore, the correlation of breast density and the change of breast volume over time was analyzed on mammography in 99 patients who were followed-up long-term after BCT.
On multivariate analysis, VBD was a predictor of cosmetic outcome after BCT with percent breast volume excised (PBVE). Decreased adipose tissue volume and increased fibrosis were more common in patients with VBD < 15%. Furthermore, remnant breast volume continued to decrease over time in low breast density patients during long-term follow-up. 93% of patients with VBD ≥ 15% and PBVE < 10% had a better cosmetic outcome, while 60% of patients with VBD < 15% and PBVE ≥ 10% had a worse cosmetic outcome after BCT.",Is volumetric breast density essential for predicting cosmetic outcome at the late stage after breast-conserving surgery?,"Yes.

All adults treated with metoclopramide for vascular type headache were eligible for entry into this clinical randomised double blinded trial. This study compared the effects of two different rates of intravenous infusion of metoclopramide over a period of 13 months at a university hospital emergency department. During the trial, side effects and headache scores were recorded at baseline (0 min), and then at 5, 15, 30 and 60 min. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare the medication's efficacy and side effects.
A total of 120 patients presenting to the emergency department met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 62 patients (51.7%) were given 10 mg metoclopramide as a slow intravenous infusion over 15 min (SIG group) and 58 patients (48.3%) were given 10 mg metoclopramide intravenous bolus infusion over 2 min (BIG group). 17 of the 58 patients in the BIG group (29.3%) and 4 of the 62 patients (6.5%) in the SIG group had akathisia (p = 0.001). There were no significant differences between the BIG and SIG groups in terms of mean headache scores (p = 0.34) and no adverse reactions in the study period. Metoclopramide successfully relieved the headache symptom(s) of patients in both the BIG and SIG groups.",Intravenous administration of metoclopramide by 2 min bolus vs 15 min infusion: does it affect the improvement of headache while reducing the side effects?,Yes.

In rats the right carotid artery was permanently occluded. MABP was lowered to 50 mmHg for 30 min. This is sufficient to reduce CBF to penumbra-like conditions in the right hemisphere. The following parameters were assessed: rCBF, DC potential, and tissue impedance. 5 or 15 min after onset of flow reduction one SD wave was initiated by microinjection of KCl. Histology was performed after 7 days.
In animals with hypotension there was depolarization resembling anoxic depolarization after SD induction and an uncoupling of CBF and metabolism only in the right hemisphere. Impedance increased with SD but did not recover spontaneously as long as rCBF remained reduced. 15 min of SD-induced cell swelling was tolerated without permanent damage, whereas 25 min were followed by severe neuron loss in the affected cortex after 7 days.",Does spreading depression induce permanent cell swelling under penumbra conditions?,Yes.

1176,12407146,"To examine the mechanism underlying transcript heterogeneity in the gene for the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR).
Transcript heterogeneity was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR), rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and transient expression of minigene constructs. Protein variants were identified by immunoblot analysis and by immunocytochemistry.
RPGR transcripts terminated either uniformly at the end of exon 19, producing the constitutive transcript with few variants, or at variable sites downstream from exon 15. The latter transcripts resembled the previously described open reading frame (ORF)14/15 variant, but the ORF14/15 exon was not found in full length. Instead, various portions of a purine-rich region were removed as introns. Numerous splice site combinations were used, giving rise to innumerable variants. Analysis of the purine-rich region found multiple exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) known to promote splicing through interaction with serine-arginine repeat (SR) proteins. Antibodies targeting different regions of RPGR detected a multitude of RPGR proteins in photoreceptors, concentrated in the connecting cilium. Predominant ORF14/15-encoded RPGR polypeptides migrated at approximately 200 kDa and were photoreceptor specific.",Does complex expression pattern of RPGR reveal a role for purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers?,Yes. The exceptional heterogeneity in RPGR transcript processing results primarily from a novel form of alternative RNA splicing mediated by multiple exonic splicing enhancers. RPGR is composed of a population of proteins with a constant N-terminal core encompassing the RCC1 homology domain followed by a C-terminal portion of variable lengths and sequences.,PASS,pubmedQA

This prospective study investigates analgesic quality after a femoral block as compared with intra-articular injection of local anesthetic.
Eighty patients scheduled for elective ACL repair under general anesthesia were included in our study. Upon completion of surgery, the patients were randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups: femoral group (n = 40) received a femoral block with 20 mL 1% ropivacaine; intra-articular group (n = 40) received 20 mL 1% ropivacaine injected intra-articularly. During the first 24 hours after surgery, all patients received 2 g propacetamol and 100 mg ketoprofen, intravenously. Additional postoperative analgesia was available with parenteral morphine if required. Analgesic duration was defined as the time from end of surgery to the first requirement for a supplemental analgesic. Data collection included patient demographics, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, analgesic duration, and morphine use. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to compare the 2 groups.
VAS score in the recovery room and during rehabilitation was higher in the intra-articular group than in the femoral group (P <.001).

Impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and an increased frequency in deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes some of the subunits of the ETC, have been reported in the substantia nigra of PD brains. The identification of mutations in the PINK1 gene, which cause an autosomal recessive form of PD, has supported mitochondrial involvement in PD. The PINK1 protein is a serine/threonine kinase localized in mitochondria and the cytosol. Its precise function is unknown, but it is involved in neuroprotection against a variety of stress signalling pathways.
In this report we have investigated the effect of silencing PINK1 expression in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells by siRNA on mtDNA synthesis and ETC function. Loss of PINK1 expression resulted in a decrease in mtDNA levels and mtDNA synthesis. We also report a concomitant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased mitochondrial ATP synthesis, with the activity of complex IV of the ETC most affected. This mitochondrial dysfunction resulted in increased markers of oxidative stress under basal conditions and increased cell death following treatment with the free radical generator paraquat.",Does silencing of PINK1 expression affect mitochondrial DNA and oxidative phosphorylation in dopaminergic cells?,Yes.

Ninety zirconia blocks were prepared and divided into 6 groups of 15 by treatment. Group 1 served as the control group, whereas groups 2 and 3 were treated with air abrasion and a universal primer (Monobond plus), respectively. The remaining zirconia copings were treated with a fractional CO2 laser for 10 seconds using 10 W/10 mJ (group 4), 10 w/14 mJ (group 5) or 20 W/10 mJ (group 6). A luting cement (Clearfil SA) was bonded to the treated zirconia surfaces and cured for 40 seconds. SBS was measured with a universal testing machine and the type of bond failure was determined.
There was a statistically significant difference in SBS among the study groups (p<0.001). The highest SBS values were observed in the groups treated with the fractional CO2 laser at settings of 20 W/10 mJ (28.1 MPa) or 10 W/14 mJ (27.4 MPa), followed by the specimens treated with the universal primer (22.8 MPa).

1861,20521332,"Among people with arthritis, the need for work transitions may signal a risk for more adverse work outcomes in the future, such as permanent work loss. Our aim was to evaluate the ability of the Work Instability Scale for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA-WIS) to predict arthritis-related work transitions within a 12-month period.
Workers with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 250) from 3 clinical sites participated in self-administered surveys that assessed the impact of health on employment at multiple time points over 12 months. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to assess the ability of the RA-WIS (range 0-23, where 23 = highest work instability) to predict 4 types of work transition: reductions in work hours, disability leaves of absence, changes in job/occupation, or temporary unemployment, assembled as a composite outcome. Covariates assessed include age, sex, education, marital status, income, pain intensity, disease duration, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCCs) were also assessed to further examine the predictive ability of the RA-WIS and to determine optimal cut points for predicting specific work transitions.
After 12 months, 21.7% (n = 50 of 230) of the participants had indicated at least one arthritis-related work transition. Higher baseline RA-WIS was predictive of such an outcome (relative risk [RR] 1.05 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.00-1.11]), particularly at >17 (RR 2.30 [95% CI 1.11-4.77]).

1874,24366371,"High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is the most commonly used sweetener in the United States. Some studies show that HFCS consumption correlates with obesity and insulin resistance, while other studies are in disagreement. Owing to conflicting and insufficient scientific evidence, the safety of HFCS consumption remains controversial.
We investigated the metabolic consequences of mice fed a (a) regular diet, (b) 'Western' high-fat diet or (c) regular diet supplemented with 8% HFCS in drinking water (to mimic soft drinks) for 10 months. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) have emerged as a major pathogenic factor for obesity and insulin resistance. ATMs consist of proinflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(+) macrophages and anti-inflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(-) macrophages. In this study, we assessed the effects of HFCS on ATMs in intra-abdominal fat.
We found that HFCS feeding in mice induced more severe adipose inflammation and insulin resistance than even the higher-calorie-containing 'Western' high-fat diet, and these HFCS-induced deleterious effects were independent of calorie intake or body fat content. We showed that similar to 'Western' high-fat diet, HFCS triggered a robust increase of both proinflammatory ATMs and anti-inflammatory ATMs in intra-abdominal fat. Remarkably, however, the anti-inflammatory ATMs were much less abundant in HFCS-fed mice than in high-fat-fed mice. Furthermore, we showed that deletion of the ghrelin receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor, GHS-R) ameliorates HFCS-induced adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. HFCS-fed GHS-R-null mice exhibit decreased proinflammatory ATMs in intra-abdominal fat, reduced adipose inflammation and attenuated liver steatosis.",Does ghrelin receptor regulate HFCS-induced adipose inflammation and insulin resistance?,"No. Our studies demonstrate that HFCS has detrimental effects on metabolism, suggesting that dietary guidelines on HFCS consumption for Americans may need to be revisited.

Senior dogs suffer from many of the chronic hepatic diseases as elderly humans, with age-related alterations in liver function influenced by diet. However, a large-scale molecular analysis of the liver tissue as affected by age and diet has not been reported in dogs.
Liver tissue samples were collected from six senior (12-year old) and six young adult (1-year old) female beagles fed an animal protein-based diet (APB) or a plant protein-based diet (PPB) for 12 months. Total RNA in the liver tissue was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip® Canine Genome Arrays. Using a 2.0-fold cutoff and false discovery rate <0.10, our results indicated that expression of 234 genes was altered by age, while 137 genes were differentially expressed by diet. Based on functional classification, genes affected by age and/or diet were involved in cellular development, nutrient metabolism, and signal transduction. In general, gene expression suggested that senior dogs had an increased risk of the progression of liver disease and dysfunction, as observed in aged humans and rodents. In particular for aged liver, genes related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and glycolysis were up-regulated, whereas genes related to regeneration, xenobiotic metabolism, and cholesterol trafficking were down-regulated. Diet-associated changes in gene expression were more common in young adult dogs (33 genes) as compared to senior dogs (3 genes).",Do age and diet affect gene expression profiles in canine liver tissue?,"Yes.

1888,22035075,"Many previous studies have evaluated the impact of mitral valve (MV) deformity scores on the percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) outcome in patients with mitral stenosis; however, the relationship between mitral annulus calcification (MAC) and the PTMC result has not yet been established. The current study aimed to investigate whether MAC could independently influence the immediate result of PTMC.
Of all patients undergoing PTMC in our institution between April 2005 and November 2009, we included 87 patients (28.7%male, mean ± SD age = 42.8 ± 12.6 years) with rheumatic mitral stenosis who had additional data on the echocardiographic evaluation of MAC along with MV leaflets morphology. Echocardiographic assessments were repeated up to six weeks after PTMC to evaluate the immediate PTMC outcome. The frequency of the optimal PTMC result (secondary MV area > = 1.5 cm(2) with > = 25% increase and without final mitral regurgitation grade > 2) was compared between two groups of patients with MAC (n = 17) and those without MAC (n = 70).
The optimal result was obtained in 55 (63.2%) patients, whereas the result was suboptimal in 32 (36.8%) patients due to insufficient MV area increase in 31(96.9%) subjects and post-procedure mitral regurgitation grade > 2 in 1(3.1%). The rate of optimal PTMC results was less in patients with MAC in comparison to those without MAC (29.4% vs.71.4%). After adjustments for possible confounders such as age and leaflets morphological subcomponents (thickening, mobility, calcification, and subvalvular thickening), MAC remained a significant negative predictor of a suboptimal PTMC result (odds ratio = 0.154; 95%CI = 0.038-0.626, p value = 0.009) together with leaflet thickening (odds ratio = 0.214; 95%CI = 0.060-0.770, p value = 0.018).",Does mitral annular calcification predict immediate results of percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy?,"No. MAC does not independently influence the immediate result of PTMC; therefore, mitral annulus evaluation may not be necessary in the echocardiographic assessment of the mitral apparatus prior to PTMC.",FAIL,pubmedQA

Mice were immunized with a purified recombinant human MPF-rabbit-Fc fusion protein and with MPF. Several hybridomas producing mAbs to MPF were established. A double-determinant (sandwich) ELISA was constructed using mAbs to two different epitopes and used to determine if MPF is present in the serum of patients with mesothelioma.
We established seven anti-MPF mAbs whose topographical epitopes were classified into three nonoverlapping groups. All the mAbs reacted with recombinant MPF protein by ELISA. One of the mAbs detected MPF and the mesothelin precursor protein containing MPF in cell lysates on Western blotting. A sandwich ELISA using mAbs to two different epitopes was constructed and used to measure the presence of MPF in the media of various mesothelin-expressing cancer cell lines and in human serum.

The serum cytokine levels [TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6] were assessed (ELISA) in these patients and 100 matched healthy controls. CSF analysis was carried out in 9 patients of this cohort, when clinically indicated.
The type of seizures (n=100) was major (45), partial (41) and status epilepticus (SE=14), while the epilepsy syndromes were idiopathic generalized (53) and localization related (47).

In this study, the colorectal cancer cell line SW480 was stably transfected with ILK plasmids, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB/p65. Methylthiazole tetrazolium (MTT) assay was performed to measure proliferation, and the wound healing migration assay and matrigel invasion assay were used to test the metastasis and invasion ability of SW480 cells. To explore the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, embryonic development, and the invasion and metastasis of tumors, the protein level of E-cadherin, vimentin, snail, and slug was detected by western blot. Immunofluorescence was also used to detect E-cadherin expression. Western blot was used to determine the level of phosphorylated-inhibitor of kappa B (IκB)a, inhibitor of gamma B (IγB)a, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) expressions and to explore the ILK signaling pathway.
Western blot results revealed that ILK expression significantly increased when ILK was overexpressed in SW480 cells (P < 0.05).

The effects of nicotine on the transient outward K(+) current (I:(to)) were studied by use of whole-cell patch-clamp techniques in canine ventricular myocytes. Nicotine potently inhibited Kv4 current. The concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC(50)) was 40+/-4 nmol/L, and the current was abolished by 100 micromol/L nicotine.

We have shown previously that, following induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, prion-infected mice succumb to disease significantly earlier than controls, concomitant with the deposition of PrP(Sc) aggregates in inflamed white matter areas. In the present work, we asked whether prion disease acceleration by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis results from infiltration of viable prion-infected immune cells into the central nervous system.
C57Bl/6 J mice underwent intraperitoneal inoculation with scrapie brain homogenates and were later induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by inoculation of MOG(35-55) in complete Freund's adjuvant supplemented with pertussis toxin.

Control groups were infected with viable and homogenized scrapie immune cells only with complete Freund's adjuvant. Prion disease incubation times as well as levels and sites of PrP(Sc) deposition were next evaluated.
We first show that acceleration of prion disease by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis requires the presence of high levels of spleen PrP(Sc).

1836,19344532,"Plastids arose from a free-living cyanobacterial endosymbiont and multiply by binary division as do cyanobacteria. Plastid division involves nucleus-encoded homologs of cyanobacterial division proteins such as FtsZ, MinD, MinE, and ARC6. However, homologs of many other cyanobacterial division genes are missing in plant genomes and proteins of host eukaryotic origin, such as a dynamin-related protein, PDV1 and PDV2 are involved in the division process. Recent identification of plastid division proteins has started to elucidate the similarities and differences between plastid division and cyanobacterial cell division. To further identify new proteins that are required for plastid division, we characterized previously and newly isolated plastid division mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana.
Leaf cells of two mutants, br04 and arc2, contain fewer, larger chloroplasts than those of wild type. We found that ARC2 and BR04 are identical to nuclear genes encoding the plastid chaperonin 60 alpha (ptCpn60alpha) and chaperonin 60 beta (ptCpn60beta) proteins, respectively. In both mutants, plastid division FtsZ ring formation was partially perturbed though the level of FtsZ2-1 protein in plastids of ptcpn60beta mutants was similar to that in wild type. Phylogenetic analyses showed that both ptCpn60 proteins are derived from ancestral cyanobacterial proteins. The A. thaliana genome encodes two members of ptCpn60alpha family and four members of ptCpn60beta family respectively. We found that a null mutation in ptCpn60alpha abolished greening of plastids and resulted in an albino phenotype while a weaker mutation impairs plastid division and reduced chlorophyll levels. The functions of at least two ptCpn60beta proteins are redundant and the appearance of chloroplast division defects is dependent on the number of mutant alleles.",Are plastid chaperonin proteins Cpn60 alpha and Cpn60 beta required for plastid division in Arabidopsis thaliana?,"No. Our results suggest that neither ptCpn60alpha nor ptCpn60beta are required for the formation of a normal plastid division apparatus, as the prokaryotic counterparts are not required for assembly of the cell division apparatus. Since moderate reduction of ptCpn60 levels did not impair normal FtsZ ring formation but did affect import of FtsZ into plastids, it is suggested that the proper levels of ptCpn60 are not required for folding of stromal plastid division proteins and/or regulation of FtsZ polymer dynamics.",FAIL,pubmedQA

212 oncological patients had a whole-body MRI at 1.5 T and/or at 3 T. The standard protocol comprised STIR and T1w sequences. All patients who showed typical signs of bone metastases were included in the study. Evaluation of the images was performed by the calculation of the number of metastases by three independent readers and by visual assessment on a 4-point scale.
86 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The total number of metastases was significantly higher on T1w than on STIR images at both field strengths (p<0.05). T1w revealed a sensitivity of 99.72% (3 T) and 100.00% (1.5 T) versus STIR with 70.99 % (3 T) and 79.34 % (1.5 T). In 53% (38/72) of all patients, STIR detected fewer bone metastases in comparison with T1w at 3 T. At 1.5 T, STIR showed inferior results in 37.5 % (18/48) of all patients. Qualitative analysis indicated a significantly better lesion conspicuity, lesion delineation and an improved image quality on T1w compared to STIR imaging at both field strengths (p<0.05) with similar results for T1w at 1.5 T and 3 T, but inferior results for STIR especially at 3 T.",MR Diagnosis of Bone Metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T: Can STIR Imaging Be Omitted?,"Yes.

Current methods of measuring coagulopathy may fail to accurately characterize in vivo clotting. We aimed to determine the effect of RBCs on clotting parameters by comparing resuscitation regimens containing RBCs and plasma with those containing plasma alone.
Thirty-two Yorkshire swine were anesthetized, subjected to a complex model of polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock, and resuscitated with either fresh frozen plasma, lyophilized plasma (LP), or 1:1 ratios of fresh frozen plasma:packed RBC (PRBC) or LP:PRBC. Activated clotting time, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and thrombelastography (TEG) were performed at 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours after resuscitation.
Animals treated with 1:1 LP:PRBC had less blood loss than the other groups (p < 0.05). The activated clotting time was shorter in the 1:1 groups when compared with the pure plasma groups at all time points (p < 0.05). The 1:1 groups had shorter TEG R times (time to onset of clotting) at 1 hour, 3 hours, and 4 hours compared with pure plasma groups (p < 0.05). Other TEG parameters did not differ between groups.

Pretreatment with melatonin prevented ocular inflammation induced by an intravitreal injection of bacterial LPS in the Syrian hamster. Here, we have assessed the anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin administered after the onset of ocular inflammation.
The eyes of male Syrian hamsters were intravitreally injected with vehicle or LPS. Melatonin was injected i.p. every 24 h, starting 12 or 24 h after the LPS injection. A clinical evaluation (with a score index based on clinical symptoms), the number of infiltrating cells, protein concentration and PGE2 and PGF2α levels in the aqueous humour, as well as retinal NOS activity, lipid peroxidation and TNF-α levels were assessed. Retinal function was assessed by scotopic electroretinography, and light microscopy and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the state of the retinal structure.
Both treatment regimens with melatonin decreased clinical symptoms, reduced the leakage of cells and proteins, and decreased PG levels in aqueous humour from eyes injected with LPS.

The mobilized stem cells are collected from the peripheral blood and used for transplantation following high doses of chemotherapy. However, the molecular mechanism by which these colony stimulating factors (CSFs) bring about proliferation of myeloid precursor cells is not clearly known. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which has an established role in DNA synthesis, could be a link between administration of CSF and stem cell proliferation. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether CSFs induce white cell proliferation by producing multiple forms of DHFR.
Twelve patients with non-haematological malignancies were treated with either G-CSF or GM-CSF to mobilize stem cells. Nine healthy subjects were treated with placebo as controls. Blood samples were obtained before and after stimulation with CSFs or placebo. White blood cells were separated and concentrations of both active DHFR and immunoreactive nonfunctional form of DHFR were determined in their cytoplasm using methotrexate-binding assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Total leucocytes count (TLC) was also monitored before and after stimulation with CSFs or placebo.
There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in concentration of immunoreactive nonfunctional form of DHFR and TLC following stimulation with CSFs. There was an increase in concentration of active DHFR as well, however, this did not reach statistical significance. In the placebo-treated subjects, no significant increase in active DHFR, immunoreactive nonfunctional form of enzyme or TLC was observed.

To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion.
In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR.
In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113±41 ml min""1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003).

1631,25255917,"NOD2 is the genetic cause of Blau syndrome, an autoinflammatory disease that manifests as coincident uveitis and arthritis. Since dysregulation of IL-1 signalling is considered a pathogenic mechanism in a number of related autoinflammatory conditions, we examined the extent to which unimpeded interleukin (IL)-1 signalling influences NOD2-dependent inflammation of the eye versus the joint.
Mice deficient for IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) were administered the NOD2 agonist muramyl dipeptide (MDP) by systemic (intraperitoneal) or local (intraocular and/or intra-articular) injections. NOD2-deficient mice received an intraocular injection of recombinant IL-1β. Uveitis was evaluated by intravital videomicroscopy and histopathology, and arthritis was assessed by near-infrared imaging and histopathology. Ocular levels of IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-1Ra were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
IL-1Ra deficiency did not render mice more responsive to systemic exposure of MDP. Despite the increased production of IL-1R agonists IL-1α and IL-1β in response to intraocular injection of MDP, deficiency in IL-1Ra did not predispose mice to MDP-triggered uveitis, albeit intravascular cell rolling and adherence were exacerbated. NOD2 expression was dispensable for the potential of IL-1 to elicit uveitis. However, we find that IL-1Ra does play an important protective role in arthritis induced locally by MDP injection in the joint.",Does aberrant interleukin-1 signalling increase susceptibility of mice to NOD2-dependent uveitis?,"Yes.

Between August 2000 and September 2002, 139 patients underwent isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) with the Mosaic (n = 67) or Perimount (n = 72) bioprosthesis. Intraoperatively, the internal aortic annulus diameter was measured by insertion of a gauge (Hegar dilator), while prosthesis size was determined by using the original sizers. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to determine hemodynamic and dimensional data. As the aim of AVR is to achieve a maximal effective orifice area (EOA) within a given aortic annulus, the ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area was calculated, the latter being based on annulus diameter measured intraoperatively.
Operative mortality was 2.2% (Mosaic 3.0%; Perimount 1.4%; p = NS). Upsizing (using a prosthesis larger in labeled valve size than the patient's measured internal aortic annulus diameter) was possible in 28.4% of Mosaic patients and 8.3% of Perimount patients. The postoperative mean systolic pressure gradient ranged from 10.5 to 22.2 mmHg in the Mosaic group, and from 9.4 to 12.6 mmHg in the Perimount group; it was significantly lower for 21 and 23 Perimount valves than for 21 and 23 Mosaic valves. The EOA ranged from 0.78 to 2.37 cm2 in Mosaic patients, and from 0.95 to 2.12 cm2 in Perimount patients.

A total of 319 consecutive patients who underwent standard polysomnography were enrolled. Fasting blood samples were obtained from all patients for biological profile measurements, and demographic data were collected. Values of FLI were determined and assessed as predictors of the presence of NAFLD, as measured by ultrasound. The discriminative ability of FLI was estimated on the basis of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve.
An FLI of 60 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy and yielded an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.822 (95% confidence interval: 0.729-0.916) in the detection of NAFLD. Patients with an FLI of 60 or higher had a significantly lower lowest O2 saturation (73 vs. 83%, P<0.001), a lower mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (93 vs. 95%, P<0.001), a higher apnea-hypopnea index (39.7 vs. 18.4, P<0.001), a higher oxygen desaturation index (39 vs. 10.6, P<0.001), and a higher percentage of sleep time spent with SpO2 less than 90% (4.63 vs. 0.92%, P<0.001) compared with those with FLI less than 60.

We investigated symptoms, gluten consumption, antibodies for CD and other autoimmunity, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typing, bone mineral density, and performed small bowel biopsies. Tolerance was defined as no immunological or histological signs of CD while consuming gluten.
Sixty-six patients accepted participation, but after review of the diagnostic biopsies 53 were found to have true CD. Twenty-three percent of patients had a gluten-containing diet, 15% admitted gluten transgression and 62% followed the GFD. Patients on a GFD had significantly more osteoporosis.

Remodeling requires cell growth and migration, which may involve reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nevertheless, the role of ROS in flow-mediated remodeling in resistance arteries is not known.
Rat mesenteric resistance arteries (MRAs) were exposed to high flow (HF) by sequentially ligating second-order MRAs in vivo. After three weeks, arteries were collected for structural, pharmacological, and biochemical analysis.
In HF arteries, luminal diameter (431+/-12 to 553+/-14 microm; n=10), endothelium (acetylcholine)-mediated vasodilatation (61+/-6 to 77+/-6% relaxation) and NAD(P)H subunit (gp91phox and p67phox) expression levels, and ROS (dihydroethydine microphotography) and peroxynitrite (3-nitro-tyrosine) production were higher than in normal flow arteries. Acute ROS scavenging with tempol improved acetylcholine-dependent relaxation (92+/-4% relaxation), confirming that ROS are produced in HF arteries. Chronic treatment with tempol prevented the increase in diameter, reduced ROS and peroxynitrite production, and improved endothelium-mediated relaxation in HF arteries. Thus, ROS and NO were involved in HF-induced diameter enlargement, possibly through the formation of peroxynitrite, while ROS reduced the increase in endothelium-dependent relaxation.",Are reactive oxygen species necessary for high flow ( shear stress ) -induced diameter enlargement of rat resistance arteries?,"No. ROS production is not necessary for flow-mediated diameter enlargement of resistance arteries.

Whether pro-inflammatory responses triggered by lipopolysaccharide in growth arrested cells differ from those in proliferating cells remains unanswered.
Olomoucine and roscovitine are cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors that prevent progression through the cell cycle. After treatment with CDK inhibitors, expression of pro-inflammatory genes was analysed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) were determined by Western blotting. Promoter activity of iNOS was measured by the luciferase activity assay.
In this study we have demonstrated that both olomoucine and roscovitine inhibit cell proliferation and diminish nitric oxide production and cytokine gene expression, in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated murine RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition, olomoucine reduces iNOS promoter activity and alleviates NF-kappaB transcription activation.

We asked whether intraoperative SCRP could lead to comparable sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values as intraoperative frozen section in revision total hip arthroplasty.
A prospective study was performed including 76 patients who underwent hip revision for any cause. SCRP quantification (using 9.5 mg/L as denoting infection) and the analysis of frozen section of intraoperative samples (five or more polymorphonuclear leukocytes under high magnification in 10 fields) were performed in all the patients. The definitive diagnosis of an infection was determined according to the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS). In this group, 30% of the patients were diagnosed with infection using the MSIS criteria (23 of 76 patients).

1546,21645374,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.
The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.",Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?,"Yes.

Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system.

These observations need to be confirmed in more rigorously designed investigations.
Increased posterior-inferior directed slope of the medial and lateral tibial plateaus are associated with increased risk of suffering a noncontact ACL injury.
Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
In sum, 176 athletes competing in organized sports at the college and high school levels participated in the study: 88 suffering their first noncontact ACL injury and 88 matched controls. Magnetic resonance images were acquired, and geometry of the subchondral bone portion of the tibial plateau was characterized on each athlete bilaterally by measuring the medial and lateral tibial plateau slopes, coronal tibial slope, and the depth of the medial tibial plateau. Comparisons between knees of the same person were made with paired t tests, and associations with injury risk were assessed by conditional logistic regression analysis of ACL-injured and control participants.
Controls exhibited side-to-side symmetry of subchondral bone geometry, while the ACL-injured athletes did not, suggesting that the ACL injury may have changed the subchondral bone geometry. Therefore, the uninjured knees of the ACL-injured athletes and the corresponding limbs of their matched controls were used to assess associations with injury risk. Analyses of males and females as a combined group and females as a separate group showed a significant association between ACL injury risk and increased posterior-inferior directed slope of the lateral tibial plateau slope. This relationship was not apparent when males were analyzed as a group. Multivariate analyses indicated that these results were independent of the medial tibial plateau slope, coronal tibial slope, and depth of the medial tibial plateau, which were not associated with ACL injury.","Is increased slope of the lateral tibial plateau subchondral bone associated with greater risk of noncontact ACL injury in females but not in males : a prospective cohort study with a nested , matched case-control analysis?","Yes.

We hypothesised that inhibition of PIM kinase activity with SGI-1776, a novel small molecule inhibitor of PIM kinase activity, would reduce the viability of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells and enhance the activity of sunitinib.
Immunoblotting, qRT-PCR, and gene expression arrays were carried out to identify genes modulated by SGI-1776 treatment. The anticancer activity of SGI-1776 and sunitinib was determined by viability and apoptosis assays and in tumour xenografts in vivo.
Treatment with SGI-1776 led to a decrease in phosphorylated and total c-Myc levels, which resulted in the modulation of c-Myc target genes. SGI-1776 in combination with sunitinib induced a further reduction in c-Myc levels, which was associated with enhanced anticancer activity. siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc demonstrated that its expression has a key role in regulating the sensitivity to the combination of SGI-1776 and sunitinib.

It is induced in several pathological conditions including cancer, obesity, and type II diabetes implying that this enzyme is implicated in other biological processes beyond its role in phase I metabolism. Despite the detailed description of the role of CYP2E1 in the liver, its functions in other tissues have not been extensively studied. In this study, we investigated the functional significance of CYP2E1 in breast carcinogenesis.
Cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by H2DCFDA (2 2.9.2 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) staining and autophagy was assessed by tracing the cellular levels of autophagy markers using western blot assays.

We investigated the effect of androgens and leptin on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) expression and secretion in human GnRH-secreting neuroblasts (FNC-B4).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR for mRNA expression and radioimmunoassay for GnRH secretion were used. Immunohistochemical studies assessed GnRH protein expression. FNC-B4 migration was analyzed with multiwell Boyden chamber technique.
Effects of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and leptin in FNC-B4 were tested after 24 and 48 hours.
Exposure to increasing concentrations of DHT after 24 hours significantly stimulated GnRH mRNA in FNC-B4. This effect was still present after prolonged exposure (48 hours). Similarly, treatment with leptin significantly induced GnRH mRNA after 24 hours, but not at 48 hours. Interestingly, mRNA for leptin receptors (LEPR) was significantly reduced after 48 hours of leptin, while, at this time point, it was stimulated by DHT. Coincubation for 48 hours with leptin and DHT maintained the stimulatory effect on both GnRH and LEPR mRNA, suggesting that DHT could stabilize the leptin effect by preventing downregulation of LEPR. Similar results were obtained for GnRH protein expression analysis. Moreover, both DHT and leptin increased GnRH release into the culture medium. We also found that DHT or leptin treatment significantly increased FNC-B4 basal migration.

Structural changes in VMH circuit morphology have the potential to alter VMH function throughout life, however, molecular signals responsible for specifying its neural connections are not fully defined. The VMH contains a high density of neurons that express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a potent neurodevelopmental effector known to regulate neuronal survival, growth, differentiation, and connectivity in a number of neural systems. In the current study, we examined whether BDNF impacts the afferent and efferent connections of the VMH, as well as energy homeostatic function.
To determine if BDNF is required for VMH circuit formation, a transgenic mouse model was used to conditionally delete Bdnf from steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) expressing neurons of the VMH prior to the onset of establishing neural connections with other regions. Projections of SF1 expressing neurons were visualized with a genetically targeted fluorescent label and immunofluorescence was used to measure the density of afferents to SF1 neurons in the absence of BDNF. Physiological changes in body weight and circulating blood glucose were also evaluated in the mutant mice.

The gene content and genomic insertion sites of Stx-associated bacteriophages differentiate clinical genotypes of EHEC O157 (CG, typical of clinical isolates) from bovine-biased genotypes (BBG, rarely identified among clinical isolates). This project was designed to identify bacteriophage-mediated differences that may affect the virulence of CG and BBG.
Stx-associated bacteriophage differences were identified by whole genome optical scans and characterized among >400 EHEC O157 clinical and cattle isolates by PCR.
Optical restriction maps of BBG strains consistently differed from those of CG strains only in the chromosomal insertion sites of Stx2-associated bacteriophages. Multiplex PCRs (stx1, stx2a, and stx2c as well as Stx-associated bacteriophage-chromosomal insertion site junctions) revealed four CG and three BBG that accounted for >90% of isolates.

1972,23698732,"Afamin was recently identified as a novel osteoclast-derived coupling factor that can stimulate the in vitro and in vivo migration of preosteoblasts.
In order to understand in more detail the biological roles of afamin in bone metabolism, we investigated its effects on osteoclastic differentiation and bone resorption.
Osteoclasts were differentiated from mouse bone marrow cells. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells were considered as osteoclasts, and the resorption area was determined by incubating the cells on dentine discs. The intracellular cAMP level was determined using a direct enzyme immunoassay. Signaling pathways were investigated using western blot and RT-PCR. Recombinant afamin was administered exogenously to bone cell cultures.
Afamin stimulated both osteoclastogenesis and in vitro bone resorption. Consistently, the expressions of osteoclast differentiation markers were significantly increased by afamin. Although afamin mainly affected the late-differentiation stages of osteoclastogenesis, the expression levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-dependent signals were not changed. Afamin markedly decreased the levels of intracellular cAMP with reversal by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), a specific inhibitor of Gi-coupled receptor signaling. In addition, PTX almost completely blocked afamin-stimulated osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, pretreatment with KN93 and STO609 - Ca2+/cal - mo dulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and CaMK kinase inhibitors, respectively - significantly prevented decreases in the intracellular cAMP level by afamin while attenuating afamin-stimulated osteoclastogenesis.",Does afamin stimulate osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption via Gi-coupled receptor and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) pathways?,Yes.

1862,9710002,"To quantify the rate of cognitive decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in autopsy-diagnosed Lewy body variant (LBV) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. We hypothesized that LBV patients would have a faster cognitive decline and shorter survival compared with patients with pure AD.
Prior reports have shown extrapyramidal signs to be associated with a poorer prognosis in AD. It has been suggested that LBV is often characterized by a rapidly progressive course. Few data are available regarding the rate of cognitive decline in autopsy-confirmed LBV dementia cases.
We searched the databases of the University of California-San Diego Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Consortium to Establish a Registry in Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) for dementia cases with 1) an autopsy diagnosis of definite or probable AD (CERAD criteria) with concomitant Lewy bodies and 2) longitudinal MMSE assessments. This resulted in a series of 40 LBV cases and 148 AD cases without Lewy bodies, with comparable baseline MMSE scores, age, and education. The rate of cognitive decline was calculated as the baseline MMSE -- final MMSE. Methods were devised to reduce floor effects on the MMSE.
The average rate of cognitive decline was -5.8 +/- 4.5 points/y in LBV and -4.1 +/- 3.0 points/y in AD (t-test, p < 0.01). The LBV group declined a similar amount on the MMSE (means, -10.0 versus -9.6 points) over a significantly shorter time interval (1.9 versus 2.7 years; p = 0.005) than did AD patients. At baseline, the mean MMSE scores were nearly identical (18.2 in LBV; 17.8 in AD), but on follow-up examinations approximately 1, 2, and 3 years later, there were intergroup mean differences of 1.8 points (two-tailed p = 0.19), 4.2 points (p = 0.04), and 5.6 points (p = 0.03), respectively. The LBV cases had shorter survival time from the onset of cognitive symptoms (7.7 +/- 3.0 years versus 9.3 +/- 3.5 years; p = 0.007) and a shorter mean survival after entry/baseline, which was of marginal significance (3.6 versus 4.1 years; p = 0.11).",Is cognitive decline faster in Lewy body variant than in Alzheimer 's disease?,No. This study demonstrates that LBV is characterized by a slower cognitive decline and decelerated mortality compared with AD.,FAIL,pubmedQA

NADPH is a key cofactor for carotenoid biosynthesis, while glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf1) and an NADH kinase (Pos5) are the two main NADPH-supplying sources in S. cerevisiae. Here, the effect of ZWF1 and POS5 overexpression on carotenoid yield in recombinant S. cerevisiae was explored. The initial carotenogenic strain Sc-EYBIH+I which expressed crtE, crtYB, crtI, cHMG1 and another copy of crtI could synthesize 1·35 ± 0·13 mg l(-1) of lycopene and 0·32 ± 0·02 mg l(-1) of β-carotene. When ZWF1 was overexpressed (Sc-EYBIZH+I), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity increased by 103-fold, the transcription level of crtE and crtI increased significantly, the lycopene and β-carotene yield increased to 2·29 ± 0·06 and 0·38 ± 0·02 mg l(-1) respectively. When POS5 was overexpressed (Sc-EYBIPH+I), NAD kinase activity increased by 5·5-fold, the transcription level of crtE, crtYB and crtI increased obviously, the lycopene and β-carotene yield increased to 2·50 ± 0·11 and 0·53 ± 0·03 mg l(-1) respectively.

1586,23497210,"Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records.

Separate Cox proportional hazard regression models were formulated based on all patients to evaluate the effects of gender on mortality, multiple organ failure, and nosocomial infection, after controlling for all important confounders. These models were then used to characterize the effect of gender in young and old age groups. Overall mortality, multiple organ failure, and nosocomial infection rates for the entire cohort (n = 1,036) were 20%, 40%, and 45%, respectively. Mean Injury Severity Score was 32 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD). Men (n = 680) and women (n = 356) were clinically similar except that men required higher crystalloid volumes, more often had a history of alcoholism and liver disease, and had greater ventilatory and intensive care unit requirements.

Insulin resistance and the concomitant compensatory hyperinsulinaemia may accelerate age-related decline in renal function through inducing glomerular hyperfiltration, even in non-diabetic subjects. This population-based study is the first to investigate whether fasting insulin concentrations modify the relationship between age and renal function in a general non-diabetic population.
Fasting insulin was measured in 3432 subjects, representing the general population. Cross-sectional analyses of the association between age, renal function and its modification by insulin were performed by means of linear regression. Renal function was assessed as 24-h creatinine clearance (CrCl) and 24-h urinary albumine excretion (UAE).
Age was 48 +/- 12 (range: 28-75) years, 44% were male, CrCl was 100 +/- 26 ml/min and UAE was 7.0 (5.4-10.7)] mg/24 h. The results confirmed a parabolic relation between age and renal function. Fasting insulin modified these parabolic relationships of age with CrCl and UAE (P < 0.001 for both interaction terms), in such a way that hyperinsulinaemia is associated with a stronger inverse parabolic relation between age and CrCl, and stronger positive parabolic relation between age and UAE at an older age than lower insulin concentrations.",Does fasting insulin modify the relation between age and renal function?,"No. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin does not accelerate the age-related decline of renal function in the general non-diabetic population.

This study was undertaken to explore whether the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the joint induces central sensitization, whether joint inflammation causes the release of IL-6 from the spinal cord, and whether spinal IL-6 contributes to central sensitization.
In anesthetized rats, electrophysiologic recordings of spinal cord neurons with sensory input from the knee joint were made. Neuronal responses to mechanical stimulation of the rat knee and leg were monitored. IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) were applied to the knee joint or the spinal cord. Spinal release of IL-6 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Soluble gp130, which neutralizes IL-6/sIL-6R, was spinally applied during the development of joint inflammation or during established inflammation.
A single injection of IL-6/sIL-6R into the rat knee joint as well as application of IL-6/sIL-6R to the rat spinal cord significantly increased the responses of spinal neurons to mechanical stimulation of the knee and ankle joint, i.e., induced central sensitization.

The median volume of ice-balls produced during inflow occlusion was 107% larger than for ice-balls produced without occlusion (P < 0.001). The median volume of cryolesions made during inflow occlusion was 195% larger than for cryolesions induced without occlusion (P < 0.001). The geometry of the ice-balls was more regular if produced during inflow occlusion than if not. The ice-balls produced during the second freeze cycle were 17% and 20% larger than the ice-ball produced during the first freeze for lesions made with (P = 0.01) and without (P = 0.03) inflow occlusion.",Does hepatic vascular inflow occlusion enhance tissue destruction during cryoablation of porcine liver?,No. Hepatic vascular inflow occlusion does not enhance freezing of larger volumes of liver tissue nor increase the volume of tissue necrosis induced during cryoablation of porcine liver.,FAIL,pubmedQA
1632,26855629,"The goal of elective orthopedic surgery is to return patients to their expected level of activity without an increased incidence of postoperative complications. The first step is identifying patient and/or surgical characteristics responsible for these complications.
This study sought to identify predictors of a step-up in medical care after non-ambulatory elective orthopedic surgery.
At a single specialty orthopedic hospital, we identified all in-hospital postoperative patients who were transferred to a higher level of medical care ((PACU) post-anesthesia care unit). The characteristics of both transferred and non-transferred patients were compared. A model was built which incorporated predictors of return to a higher level of care.
During a 1-year period, 155 of 7967 patients (1.95%) required transfer to the PACU within 5 days of surgery. Cardiac complications were the major reason for transfer (50.3%), followed by pulmonary (11.0%) and neurological complications (9.7%). Patients who returned to the PACU were older, had more Exlihauser comorbidities, and had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In a model adjusting for all patient characteristics: age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, congestive heart failure (CHF), the Charlson comorbidity index and OSA predicted return to the PACU.",Is the Need for a Step-up in Postoperative Medical Care Predictable in Orthopedic Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery?,"Yes. In an elderly population with multiple comorbidities undergoing elective common major orthopedic procedures, approximately 5% of patients required readmission to the PACU. The most common problems requiring this step-up in care were cardiac and pulmonary, which resulted in an increased length of hospital stay. Patients with OSA and multiple comorbidities undergoing total knee arthroplasty carry an increased risk for postoperative complications.",FAIL,pubmedQA
1637,22401324,"The objective is to report a contemporary population-based estimate of hypoglycemia requiring emergency medical services (EMS), its burden on medical resources, and its associated mortality in patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM, non-DM), which will enable development of prospective strategies that will capture hypoglycemia promptly and provide an integrated approach for prevention of such episodes.
We retrieved all ambulance calls activated for hypoglycemia in Olmsted County, Minnesota, between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2009.
A total of 1473 calls were made by 914 people (DM 8%, non-DM 16%, unknown DM status 3%). Mean age was 60 ± 16 years with 49% being female. A higher percentage of calls were made by DM patients (87%) with proportionally fewer calls coming from non-DM patients (11%) (chi-square test, p < .001), and the remaining 2% calls by people with unknown DM status. Emergency room transportation and hospitalization were significantly higher in non-DM patients compared to DM patients (p < .001) and type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to type 1 diabetes mellitus (p < .001). Sulphonylureas alone or in combination with insulin varied during the study period (p = .01). The change in incidence of EMS for hypoglycemia was tracked during this period. However, causality has not been established. Death occurred in 240 people, 1.2 (interquartile range 0.2-2.7) years after their first event. After adjusting for age, mortality was higher in non-DM patients compared with DM patients (p < .001) but was not different between the two types of DM.",Does population-based study of severe hypoglycemia requiring emergency medical service assistance reveal unique findings?,"Yes.

We investigated the effect of the deletion of caveolin 1, using caveolin 1 knockout mice, on the expression of aquaporin 1 in order to identify their relation in the urothelium of the urinary bladder.
The cellular localization and expressions of aquaporin 1 and caveolin 1, in the wild type and caveolin 1 knockout mice urinary bladder, were examined by Western blot and immunofluorescence techniques.
Aquaporin 1 and caveolin 1 were coexpressed in the arterioles, venules, and capillaries of the suburothelial layer in the wild type controls. Aquaporin 1 protein expression was significantly higher in the caveolin 1 knockout mice than in the wild type controls (P <0.05).",Is loss of Caveolin 1 Associated With the Expression of Aquaporin 1 and Bladder Dysfunction in Mice?,No. The results imply that aquaporin 1 and caveolin 1 do not share a distinct relation with the bladder signal activity.

1835,23221421,"We have shown that indomethacin has the potential to activate Ca2+/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), regardless of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. To understand the underlying mechanism, the present study investigated the effect of indomethacin on protein phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B).
Activity of CaMKII was assayed in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and under the cell-free conditions. Activities of protein phosphatases were monitored under the cell-free conditions. Indomethacin binding assay was carried out using a fluorescein-conjugated indomethacin.
Indomethacin enhanced CaMKII activity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, that is abolished the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. In the cell-free assay, no CaMKII activation was obtained with indomethacin, but indomethacin otherwise inhibited PP1 in a concentration (10 µM-1 mM)-dependent manner, the maximum reaching 70% of basal levels. This indicates that indomethacin indirectly activates CaMKII due to PP1 inhibition. Likewise, indomethacin still inhibited PP2A and PTP1B in a concentration (10 µM-1 mM)-dependent manner, reaching 80 and 10% of basal levels at 1 mM, respectively. In the indomethacin binding assay, indomethacin bound to all the investigated protein phosphatases.",Does indomethacin serve as a potential inhibitor of protein phosphatases?,"Yes. The results of the present study indicate that indomethacin inhibits PP1, PP2A, and PTP1B, possibly through its direct binding and that the inhibitory effect of indomethacin on PP1 could cause indirect CaMKII inhibition. This may represent the novel indomethacin action.",FAIL,pubmedQA
1525,27096199,"Multiple viruses are often detected in children with respiratory infection but the significance of co-infection in pathogenesis, severity and outcome is unclear.
To correlate the presence of viral co-infection with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections (ARI).
We collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011-2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK.
204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 7.484; P-value<0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value<0.001). In addition, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of degree of respiratory distress (OR: 2.917; P-value = 0.035), PICU admission (OR: 0.301; P-value = 0.011), lower clinical score (-1.499; P-value = 0.021) respiratory support requirement (OR: 0.324; P-value = 0.016) and oxygen necessity (OR: 0.328; P-value = 0.001). All these findings were replicated in the UK cohort.",Does Viral Co-Infection Influence the Severity of Acute Respiratory Infection in Children?,"Yes.

Participants were recruited from the US population through random-digit-dialing and probability sampling. Analyses included 2703 postmenopausal women 40-65 years old in our Menopause Epidemiology Study. Respondents answered a 30-min questionnaire, including the MENQOL.
Scores for each domain were: vasomotor: 3.2+/-2.2; psycho-social: 3.3+/-1.8; physical: 3.5+/-1.5; sexual: 2.9+/-2.1. There were significant differences in the MENQOL scores by age, smoking, exercise, education, employment status and BMI.

1781,21548917,"Subclinical inflammation is a common phenomenon in patients on either continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). We hypothesized that vitamin C had anti-inflammation effect because of its electron offering ability. The current study was designed to test the relationship of plasma vitamin C level and some inflammatory markers.
In this cross-sectional study, 284 dialysis patients were recruited, including 117 MHD and 167 CAPD patients. The demographics were recorded. Plasma vitamin C was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. And we also measured body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight/height(2)), Kt/V, serum albumin, serum prealbumin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ferritin, hemoglobin. The relationships between vitamin C and albumin, pre-albumin and hsCRP levels were tested by Spearman correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. Patients were classified into three subgroups by vitamin C level according to previous recommendation 12 in MHD and CAPD patients respectively: group A: < 2 ug/ml (< 11.4 umol/l, deficiency), group B: 2-4 ug/ml (11.4-22.8 umol/l, insufficiency) and group C: > 4 ug/ml (> 22.8 umol/l, normal and above).
Patients showed a widely distribution of plasma vitamin C levels in the total 284 dialysis patients. Vitamin C deficiency (< 2 ug/ml) was present in 95(33.45%) and insufficiency (2-4 ug/ml) in 88(30.99%). 73(25.70%) patients had plasma vitamin C levels within normal range (4-14 ug/ml) and 28(9.86%) at higher than normal levels (> 14 ug/ml). The similar proportion of different vitamin C levels was found in both MHD and CAPD groups. Plasma vitamin C level was inversely associated with hsCRP concentration (Spearman r = -0.201, P = 0.001) and positively associated with prealbumin (Spearman r = 0.268, P < 0.001), albumin levels (Spearman r = 0.161, P = 0.007). In multiple linear regression analysis, plasma vitamin C level was inversely associated with log(10)hsCRP (P = 0.048) and positively with prealbumin levels (P = 0.002) adjusted for gender, age, diabetes, modality of dialysis and some other confounding effects.",Is low levels of vitamin C in dialysis patients associated with decreased prealbumin and increased C-reactive protein?,Yes. The investigation indicates that vitamin C deficiency is common in both MHD patients and CAPD patients. Plasma vitamin C level is negatively associated with serum prealbumin level and positively associated with hsCRP level in both groups. Vitamin C deficiency may play an important role in the increased inflammatory status in dialysis patients.

Behind the background of possible lymphangiogenesis-associated therapies, the clinical impact of lymphangiogenesis (measured by lymphatic microvessel density [LMVD]) and specific lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in esophageal cancer remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical role of lymphangiogenesis and LVI in a large cohort of esophageal cancer.
For the specific assessment of LMVD and LVI, 393 tissue samples from a prospective tissue databank of esophageal adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and their precursor lesions were included into this study. LMVD and LVI were assessed by immunostaining for podoplanin, a selective marker of lymphatic endothelium. In addition the peritumoral inflammatory stroma reaction (ISR) was assessed.
Patients with high LMVD had a significant increased risk to develop LVI (P = .00123; coefficient of regression [CR] 0.27) and lymph node metastasis (P = .00233), independent of the tumor's histology. During a follow-up of 52 months, patients with high LMVD had a significantly reduced overall survival (OS; P < .001; 5-year OS 30% vs 54%) and disease-free survival (DFS; P < .001; 5-year DFS 28% vs 48%).

Functional measures of frailty and clinical data were collected prospectively for all cardiac surgery patients at a single center. Frailty was defined as any impairment in activities of daily living (Katz index), ambulation, or a documented history of dementia. Of 3826 patients, 157 (4.1%) were frail. Frail patients were older, were more likely to be female, and had risk factors for adverse surgical outcomes. By logistic regression, frailty was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0), as well as institutional discharge (odds ratio 6.3, 95% CI 4.2 to 9.4).

Male SD rats were trained daily for 15 d to self-administer heroin or milk tablets in a classic runway drug self-administration model. Immunohistochemical assay was used to quantify Arc protein expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the ventrolateral striatum (VLS) in response to chronic self-administration of heroin or milk tablets. NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 (0.1 mg/kg) or dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.03 mg/kg) were intravenously injected at the same time as heroin was infused intravenously.
Runway training with heroin resulted in robust enhancement of Arc expression in the mPFC, the NAc and the DMS on d 1, 7, and 15, and in the VLS on d 1 and d 7. However, runway training with milk led to increased Arc expression in the mPFC, the NAc and the DMS only on d 7 and/or d 15 but not on d 1.

2836,financebench_id_00012,"In 2022, total restaurant margins increased 5% (11% in constant currencies), which reflected strong sales performance across all segments.
Franchised margins represented nearly 90% of restaurant margin dollars.
Total restaurant margin growth was negatively impacted in both periods by foreign currency translation due to the weakening of all major currencies against
the U.S. Dollar.
Franchised margins in the U.S. reflected higher depreciation costs related to investments in restaurant modernization.
Company-operated margins in the U.S. and International Operated Markets segment reflected positive sales performance driven by strategic menu price
increases, and the negative impact of inflationary pressures. Results in the International Operated Markets segment were also negatively impacted by the
restaurant closures in Russia and Ukraine.
Total restaurant margins included $1,501 million of depreciation and amortization expenses in 2022

of its segments, resulting in inventories that are recorded at the lower of cost or market or net realizable value, as appropriate.

Walmart U.S. Segment - Inventories are primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting (""RIM"") to determine inventory cost,
using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") valuation method. RIM generally results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent
markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.

Walmart International Segment Depending on the store format in each market, inventories are generally accounted for using either the RIM or
weighted-average cost method, using the first-in, first-out valuation method.

Sam's Club Segment - The majority of this segment's inventory is accounted for and valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method.

News Release
Intel Announces Termination of Tower Semiconductor Acquisition
Intel continues to advance plans to create world-class system foundry as part of its IDM 2.0 strategy.
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 16, 2023 Intel Corporation (Nasdaq: INTC) today announced that it has mutually agreed with Tower Semiconductor (Nasdaq:
TSEM) to terminate its previously disclosed agreement to acquire Tower due to the inability to obtain in a timely manner the regulatory approvals required under
the merger agreement, dated Feb. 15, 2022. In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and in connection with its termination, Intel will pay a
termination fee of $353 million to Tower.
Our foundry efforts are critical to unlocking the full potential of IDM 2.0, and we continue to drive forward on all facets of our strategy, said Pat Gelsinger, CEO
of Intel. We are executing well on our roadmap to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025, building momentum with
customers and the broader ecosystem and investing to deliver the geographically diverse and resilient manufacturing footprint the world needs. Our respect for
Tower has only grown through this process, and we will continue to look for opportunities to work together in the future.
Stuart Pann, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Foundry Services (IFS), said, Since its launch in 2021, Intel Foundry Services has gained
traction with customers and partners, and we have made significant advancements toward our goal of becoming the second-largest global external foundry by
the end of the decade. We are building a differentiated customer value proposition as the worlds first open system foundry, with the technology portfolio and
manufacturing expertise that includes packaging, chiplet standards and software, going beyond traditional wafer manufacturing.
IFS has made significant strides over the past year as demonstrated by its more than 300% year-over-year revenue increase in the second quarter of 2023.
This momentum is further illustrated by Intels recent agreement with Synopsys to develop a portfolio of intellectual property (IP) on Intel 3 and Intel 18A
process nodes. Intel was also awarded the first phase of the U.S. Department of Defenses Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes - Commercial (RAMP-C)
program, with five RAMP-C customers in design engagement on Intel 18A. In addition, Intel landed a multigeneration agreement with Arm to enable chip
designers to build low-power compute system-on-chips (SoCs) on 18A, and Intel signed a strategic partnership with MediaTek to use IFS advanced process
technologies.

Accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances such as a change in reporting units or the
testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division.
As described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2022, the Company changed its business segment reporting. For any product changes that resulted in reporting unit
changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units, the results of which were immaterial.
Goodwill balances reported above reflect these business segment reporting changes in the earliest period presented. The Company also completed its annual goodwill
impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2022 for all reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Additionally, in December 2022, as a result of 3M's commitment
to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing as described in Note 15, 3M recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $0.3 billion related to the
Advanced Materials reporting unit (within the Transportation and Electronics business) resulting in no remaining goodwill for that reporting unit. This also represents the
Company's accumulated goodwill impairment losses as of December 31, 2022.
","Was there any major movement in 3M's Goodwill in 2022, and what were the key drivers?","There was a significant increase of $287 million in goodwill on 3M's balance sheet in 2022, primarily driven by two major events: 1. Goodwill addition of $271 million for the Advanced Materials reporting unit (within the Transportation and Electronics business) as the company announced a plan to expand PFAS-based manufacturing. 2. $16 million addition of Goodwill related to the acquisition of a Food Safety Business in 2022.",FAIL,FinanceBench

Some of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others for both long-
standing products (e.g., Reeses Puffs for cereal, Green Giant for vegetables in certain countries, and Yoplait and related brands for 
fresh dairy in the United States and Canada), and shorter term promotional products (e.g., fruit snacks sold under various third party 
equities).
We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand 
names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and 
preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new 
products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building approach is the key to winning and sustaining leading share 
positions in markets around the globe.

Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are
principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, United
Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Spain, France, China, and Iceland. Costco operated 838, 815, and 795 warehouses worldwide at
August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol COST.
We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first
three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week
year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2022,
2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively.

",What is the FY2017 - FY2019 3 year average net profit margin (as a %) for Apple? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Provide a response to the question by primarily using the statement of income.,22.1%,FAIL,FinanceBench
2180,financebench_id_00903,"Our Customers
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized
independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture
certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right
to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process
required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing
our trademarks for specified geographic areas.
We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the
consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees,
promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated
annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support,
new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and
promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent
bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as
point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs
support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary
annually.
Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer
businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard
discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2022, sales to
Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sams Club (Sams), represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net
revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used
in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA
and PBNA divisions.

2278,financebench_id_00033,"Total gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points compared to 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross
margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. This was primarily due to a 33 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories,
predominantly driven by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries, and 19 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise
costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by one basis point due to increased 2% rewards. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses
positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was positively
impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the negative impact of a one-time
charge related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively
impacted gross margin by approximately $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International Operations.
