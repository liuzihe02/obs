The sirloin is actually divided into several types of steak.

",what is the difference between sirloin steak and porterhouse steak,"Based on the given passages, here's the difference between sirloin steak and porterhouse steak:

According to passage 1, Porterhouse steaks are cut from further back on the sirloin and contain a bit more of the tenderloin or fillet than T-Bone steaks. This results in a corresponding price difference.

Passage 2 confirms that T-Bone and Porterhouse steaks are the same, with the Porterhouse being a larger version of the T-Bone due to its larger portion of the tenderloin.

Passage 3 does not provide any information related to the difference between sirloin steak and porterhouse steak.

Therefore, the main difference between sirloin steak and porterhouse steak is the size and the amount of tenderloin or fillet included in the cut, with porterhouse steak being larger and containing more tenderloin.",FAIL,RAGTruth,fewshot_gpt,1

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of simvastatin on serum Vitamin D status in dyslipidemic patients as Vitamin D status has an impact on monocyte/macrophage function and may also contribute to cardiovascular risk.
Selected individuals (n = 102) were treated with simvastatin (40 mg/day), or matching placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Each treatment period (with simvastatin or placebo) lasted for 30 days and was separated by a 2-week washout phase. Serum Vitamin D concentration was assessed pre- and post-treatment.
Seventy-seven completed the trial, noncompliance with the study protocol and drug intolerance or relocation were the causes for drop-out. No significant carry-over effect was observed for the assessed parameters. There was a reduction in the serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.001), total cholesterol (P < 0.001), and triglycerides (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, simvastatin therapy did not significantly affect serum level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and Vitamin D level (P > 0.05).",Does simvastatin Treatment Affect Serum Vitamin D Concentrations in Patients with Dyslipidemia : A Randomized Double-blind Placebo-controlled Cross-over Trial?,No. Short-term treatment with simvastatin (40 mg/day) does not have a significant affect on serum levels of Vitamin D.,PASS,pubmedQA,fewshot_gpt,1
15136629,"This study was performed to prospectively evaluate fast PET/CT imaging protocols using lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) detector technology and 3-dimensional (3D) image-acquisition protocols.
Fifty-seven consecutive patients (30 male, 27 female; mean age, 58.6 +/- 15.7 y) were enrolled in the study. After intravenous injection of 7.77 MBq (0.21 mCi) of (18)F-FDG per kilogram, a standard whole-body CT study (80-110 s) and PET emission scan were acquired for 4 min/bed position in 49 patients and 3 min/bed position in 8 patients. One-minute-per-bed-position data were then extracted from the 3- or 4-min/bed position scans to reconstruct single-minute/bed position scans for each patient. Patients were subgrouped according to weight as follows: <59 kg (<130 lb; n = 15), 59-81 kg (130-179 lb; n = 33), and >or=82 kg (>or=180 lb; n = 9). Three experienced observers recorded numbers and locations of lesion by consensus and independently rated image quality as good, moderate, poor, or nondiagnostic.
The observers analyzed 220 reconstructed whole-body PET images from 57 patients. They identified 114 lesions ranging in size from 0.7 to 7.0 cm on the 3- (n = 8) and 4-min/bed position images (n = 49). Of these, only 4 were missed on the 1-min/bed position scans, and all lesions were identified on the corresponding 2-min/bed position images.
