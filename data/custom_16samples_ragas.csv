15712,"passage 1:The difference between the two is that Porterhouse steaks are cut from further back on the sirloin and therefore contains a bit more of the tenderloin or fillet than T-Bone steaks and there’s a corresponding price difference.-Bone and Porterhouse cuts of steaks are prepared in a similar way, involving a vertical cut that encompasses elements of both the fillet and front of the sirloin (what the Americans call the short loin) on either side of a distinctive T shaped bone.

passage 2:T-Bone Versus Porterhouse Steaks. T-Bone steaks and Porterhouse steaks are the same. The Porterhouse is just a larger version of the T-Bone because it is carved from the larger portion of the tenderloin.A Porterhouse is the King of the T-Bones.

The sirloin is actually divided into several types of steak.

",what is the difference between sirloin steak and porterhouse steak,"Based on the given passages, here's the difference between sirloin steak and porterhouse steak:

According to passage 1, Porterhouse steaks are cut from further back on the sirloin and contain a bit more of the tenderloin or fillet than T-Bone steaks. This results in a corresponding price difference.

Passage 2 confirms that T-Bone and Porterhouse steaks are the same, with the Porterhouse being a larger version of the T-Bone due to its larger portion of the tenderloin.

Passage 3 does not provide any information related to the difference between sirloin steak and porterhouse steak.

Therefore, the main difference between sirloin steak and porterhouse steak is the size and the amount of tenderloin or fillet included in the cut, with porterhouse steak being larger and containing more tenderloin.",FAIL,RAGTruth

",differences and similarities between red and white blood cells,"Based on the provided passages, here are the differences and similarities between red blood cells and white blood cells:

Differences:

* Function: Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body, while white blood cells are part of the immune system and help fight off diseases and infections.
* Composition: Red blood cells lack a nucleus and most organelles, while white blood cells have a nucleus and various organelles.

Similarities:

* Both are found in blood.
* Both are formed from pluripotent stem cells in red bone marrow.
* Both have a cell membrane and cytoplasm.

Therefore, the main difference between red blood cells and white blood cells is their function and composition, while they share similarities in terms of their origin and basic cellular structure.",FAIL,RAGTruth
27330686,"Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are antihyperlipidemic drugs with an established efficacy in stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques and preventing atherogenesis and reducing cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of simvastatin on serum Vitamin D status in dyslipidemic patients as Vitamin D status has an impact on monocyte/macrophage function and may also contribute to cardiovascular risk.
Selected individuals (n = 102) were treated with simvastatin (40 mg/day), or matching placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Each treatment period (with simvastatin or placebo) lasted for 30 days and was separated by a 2-week washout phase. Serum Vitamin D concentration was assessed pre- and post-treatment.
Seventy-seven completed the trial, noncompliance with the study protocol and drug intolerance or relocation were the causes for drop-out. No significant carry-over effect was observed for the assessed parameters. There was a reduction in the serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.001), total cholesterol (P < 0.001), and triglycerides (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, simvastatin therapy did not significantly affect serum level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and Vitamin D level (P > 0.05).",Does simvastatin Treatment Affect Serum Vitamin D Concentrations in Patients with Dyslipidemia : A Randomized Double-blind Placebo-controlled Cross-over Trial?,No. Short-term treatment with simvastatin (40 mg/day) does not have a significant affect on serum levels of Vitamin D.,PASS,pubmedQA
15136629,"This study was performed to prospectively evaluate fast PET/CT imaging protocols using lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) detector technology and 3-dimensional (3D) image-acquisition protocols.
Fifty-seven consecutive patients (30 male, 27 female; mean age, 58.6 +/- 15.7 y) were enrolled in the study. After intravenous injection of 7.77 MBq (0.21 mCi) of (18)F-FDG per kilogram, a standard whole-body CT study (80-110 s) and PET emission scan were acquired for 4 min/bed position in 49 patients and 3 min/bed position in 8 patients. One-minute-per-bed-position data were then extracted from the 3- or 4-min/bed position scans to reconstruct single-minute/bed position scans for each patient. Patients were subgrouped according to weight as follows: <59 kg (<130 lb; n = 15), 59-81 kg (130-179 lb; n = 33), and >or=82 kg (>or=180 lb; n = 9). Three experienced observers recorded numbers and locations of lesion by consensus and independently rated image quality as good, moderate, poor, or nondiagnostic.
The observers analyzed 220 reconstructed whole-body PET images from 57 patients. They identified 114 lesions ranging in size from 0.7 to 7.0 cm on the 3- (n = 8) and 4-min/bed position images (n = 49). Of these, only 4 were missed on the 1-min/bed position scans, and all lesions were identified on the corresponding 2-min/bed position images. One- and 2-min/bed position image quality differed significantly from the 4-min/bed position image reference (P < 0.05).",Do impact of patient weight and emission scan duration on PET/CT image quality and lesion detectability?,Yes. LSO PET detector technology permits fast 3D imaging protocols whereby weight-based emission scan durations ranging from 1 to 3 min/bed position provide similar lesion detectability when compared with 4-min/bed position images.,PASS,pubmedQA
23676712,"This study estimates the prevalence of disability among late middle-aged women and identifies important correlates of disability among this population.
Disability was assessed among 376 participants of the Michigan Study of Women's Health Across the Nation cohort at the 2011 follow-up using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Demographic and health measures were related to disability status using logistic regression models (none or mild vs. moderate, severe, or extreme disability).
Nearly 25% of women reported moderate to extreme global disability. African American race/ethnicity, economic strain, peripheral neuropathy, and depressive symptomatology were associated with global disability. Obesity, knee osteoarthritis, and hypertension were only associated with disability for the mobility domain (getting around).",Does prevalence and correlate of disability in a late middle-aged population of women?,No. The prevalence of disability is relatively low among this population of late middle-aged women. Efforts to prevent or forestall disability should be extended to include middle-aged populations as they may be most amenable to intervention.,FAIL,pubmedQA
