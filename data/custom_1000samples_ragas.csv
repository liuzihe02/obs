passage 2:Fire is the mechanism by which the forest is continually regenerated, states Hall. Fires consume dead, decaying vegetation accumulating on the forest floor, thereby clearing the way for new growth. Some species, such as the jack pine, even rely on fire to spread their seeds. The jack pine produces seratonous (resin-filled) cones that are very durable. The cones remain dormant until a fire occurs and melts the resin. Then the cones pop open and the seeds fall or blow out. In the Canadian boreal forest, aspen and jack pine are the most important ‘pioneer species’, observes Hall.

passage 3:Spruce have better access to sunlight while shading the other trees with their more dense canopies. Consequently, the jack pine and aspen begin dying out in regions where spruce trees are plentiful. But, should another fire come and disturb this cycle, the more fire-tolerant jack pine and aspen regain the advantage and again proliferate.

Additionally, passage 3 suggests that while spruce trees may outcompete jack pine and aspen in some areas, fires can disrupt this cycle and allow jack pine and aspen to regain an advantage.

Toprol can be taken once a day and Lopressor is usually taken at least twice a day.

passage 2:Tartrate vs Succinate. The key difference between tartrate and succinate is that succinate is derived from the succinic acid and tartrate is derived from the tartaric acid. These two chemical substances are widely used in the beverage industry and drug manufacturing.Succinic acid is ethan-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. Succinate form of metoprolol is an extended release drug and it plays its role in the circulatory system for 24 hours. However, the tartrate form of metoprolol does not appear in the blood stream for 24 hours because metoprolol tartrate is an immediate-release drug.

passage 3:Release time. The primary difference between metoprolol succinate and metoprolol tartrate is the length of time that the drugs stay in your bloodstream. Metoprolol succinate will stay in a person's bloodstream for 24 complete hours. This means that the medication is a once per day pill.Metoprolol tartrate, on the other hand, will not stay in the bloodstream as long and thus needs to be taken at regular intervals.etoprolol succinate has a greater dehydrating effect. Thus, the side effects constipation and dry mouth are primarily associated with this version of the medication. Conversely, metoprolol tartrate may cause diarrhea. It also has the potential to cause sleep issues such as insomnia or unusual dreams.

Conjoined twins: When the division of the developing zygote into 2 embryos occurs, 99% of the time it is within 8 days of fertilization. Mortality is highest for conjoined twins due to the many complications resulting from shared organs.

passage 3:Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy. Twins can be either monozygotic (identical), meaning that they develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic (fraternal), meaning that they develop from two different eggs. In fraternal twins, each twin is fertilized by its own sperm cell. In contrast, a fetus that develops alone in the womb is called a singleton, and the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is multiple. Non-related look-alikes whose resemblance parallels that of twins are referred to as doppelgangers.

We are looking at the difference between elements, compounds, and mixtures. Elements are the purest form of a chemical substance and are composed of only one type of atom. In other words, all of the atoms in an element will have the same number of protons.

",differences between elements compounds and mixtures,"Based on the given passages, the main differences between elements, compounds, and mixtures are:

* Elements are the purest form of a chemical substance and are composed of only one type of atom. They have a fixed composition and cannot be broken down into simpler substances by physical means.
* Compounds, on the other hand, are substances composed of two or more different elements that are chemically bonded together. They have a fixed composition and are pure substances.
* Mixtures are physical combinations of elements or compounds where the parts of the mixture are not chemically bonded and retain their own identity. They have a variable composition and can be separated by physical means.

Therefore, the key differences between elements, compounds, and mixtures are their composition, bonding, and separability.

If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.

passage 2:Question: Why should I want to serve God?. Answer: The fact that we should serve God is obvious in Scripture (see Luke 4:8). Why we should want to serve God is a more difficult question. Every Christian asked might have a different reason for serving God; different people are motivated by different things.However, the Bible does make clear that, when a person is in a real relationship with God, he will serve God.We should want to serve God because we know Him; an inherent part of knowing Him is a desire to serve Him. It’s always been God’s intention to make us like His Son, Jesus (Romans 8:29).f you want to want to serve God, the key is to get to know Him! Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal more of God to you (John 16:13). When we truly know God, who is love (1 John 4:8), our natural response is a desire to love and serve Him in return.

passage 3:If we are serving others for those reasons, we are not serving or loving properly. Instead, we are serving others as a way to serve ourselves. This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t choose to serve if we feel it is the right thing to do in a given situation or to build and strengthen our character muscles.hen we learn to serve in this way our rewards are so much greater than if we were to serve with self-serving motives. Because we serve out of love with no stipulations or expectations of anything in return, it no longer matters what we get out of it.

",why should we serve others,"Based on the given passages, here's a brief answer to the question ""Why should we serve others?""

We should serve others because it is a way to show love and kindness to everyone, even those who may not treat us well. Serving others is an expression of our love for God and our desire to be like Him. When we truly know God, our natural response is a desire to love and serve Him in return, and serving others is a way to do so.

That's the concept behind your carbon footprint, which is one method of measuring the environmental effect of your lifestyle. A carbon footprint, measured in tons, indicates the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are produced as a result of your daily activities. You can reduce your footprint by changing the way you live your life. Even seemingly tiny changes can make a significant difference.

passage 2:It all comes back to the average carbon footprint. The average per capita carbon footprint is 6 tons per year. In the U.S. the average is 20 tons per year, and a third of that is created by automobile emissions -- meaning your car itself can put out over 6 tons of C02 a year -- enough for two people.

passage 3:So what exactly is a carbon footprint? In simplest terms, carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases produced by various human activities within a given time frame. Carbon footprint is usually measured in tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere. Your home has a carbon footprint if you use oil, coal or gas to heat it. That cheeseburger at your favorite restaurant has a carbon footprint: raising the beef and wheat and operating the restaurant all involves greenhouse gases. Your car has a carbon footprint, dependent on the vehicle’s fuel consumption and driving distance.

",what is the effect of carbon footprint,"Based on the given passages, it is clear that the effect of a carbon footprint is a measure of the negative impact of human activities on the environment.

passage 2:Fire is the mechanism by which the forest is continually regenerated, states Hall. Fires consume dead, decaying vegetation accumulating on the forest floor, thereby clearing the way for new growth. Some species, such as the jack pine, even rely on fire to spread their seeds. The jack pine produces seratonous (resin-filled) cones that are very durable. The cones remain dormant until a fire occurs and melts the resin. Then the cones pop open and the seeds fall or blow out. In the Canadian boreal forest, aspen and jack pine are the most important ‘pioneer species’, observes Hall.

passage 3:Spruce have better access to sunlight while shading the other trees with their more dense canopies. Consequently, the jack pine and aspen begin dying out in regions where spruce trees are plentiful. But, should another fire come and disturb this cycle, the more fire-tolerant jack pine and aspen regain the advantage and again proliferate.

This is accomplished by using a small amount of electricity to control a gate on a much larger supply of electricity, much like turning a valve to control a supply of water.he base pulls these electrons from the emitter because it has a more positive voltage than does the emitter. This movement of electrons creates a flow of electricity through the transistor. The current passes from the emitter to the collector through the base.

passage 2:A transistor is a miniature electronic component that can do two different jobs. It can work either as an amplifier or a switch: 1  When it works as an amplifier, it takes in a tiny electric current at one end (an input current) and produces a much bigger electric current (an output current) at the other.2  Transistors can also work as switches.ormally, the holes in the base act like a barrier, preventing any significant current flow from the emitter to the collector while the transistor is in its off state. A transistor works when the electrons and the holes start moving across the two junctions between the n-type and p-type silicon.

",what is a transistor how does it work,"Sure, I'll do my best to help you! Here's a brief answer to your question based on the given passages:

A transistor is a semiconductor device that can function as an amplifier or a switch. It consists of three layers of a semiconductor material with different electrical properties, known as the base, collector, and emitter. The base is connected to a voltage source, and the collector and emitter are connected to the input and output circuits, respectively. When a small voltage is applied to the base, it controls the flow of current between the collector and emitter, allowing the transistor to act as an amplifier or a switch. The transistor can amplify a weak signal by multiplying it with a factor called beta (β), which is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors.

",why am i not getting a toned body if i do extersice every day,"Based on the provided passages, here's my answer:

If you are not getting a toned body despite exercising every day, it could be due to two reasons:

1. Lack of muscle mass: As passage 1 states, having muscle is essential for having a toned body. If you don't have enough muscle mass, no amount of exercise will give you a toned appearance. You may need to focus on building muscle through strength training exercises before worrying about reducing body fat.
2. High body fat percentage: Passage 2 emphasizes that having a low body fat percentage is necessary to achieve a toned look. If you have a high body fat percentage, it will be harder to see your muscle definition, regardless of how much you exercise. To reduce body fat, you may need to adjust your diet and focus on burning fat through cardiovascular exercises.

passage 2:Fire is the mechanism by which the forest is continually regenerated, states Hall. Fires consume dead, decaying vegetation accumulating on the forest floor, thereby clearing the way for new growth. Some species, such as the jack pine, even rely on fire to spread their seeds. The jack pine produces seratonous (resin-filled) cones that are very durable. The cones remain dormant until a fire occurs and melts the resin. Then the cones pop open and the seeds fall or blow out. In the Canadian boreal forest, aspen and jack pine are the most important ‘pioneer species’, observes Hall.

passage 3:Spruce have better access to sunlight while shading the other trees with their more dense canopies. Consequently, the jack pine and aspen begin dying out in regions where spruce trees are plentiful. But, should another fire come and disturb this cycle, the more fire-tolerant jack pine and aspen regain the advantage and again proliferate.

",how are forest fires beneficial to conifers like jack pines?,"Based on the given passages, forest fires are beneficial to conifers like jack pines because they:

1. Provide a mechanism for the tree to regenerate and grow rapidly after a fire (Passage 1).
2. Clear the way for new growth by consuming dead, decaying vegetation on the forest floor (Passage 2).
3. Spread their seeds through serotinous cones that open during a fire, allowing the tree to propagate (Passage 2).

Therefore, forest fires play a crucial role in the life cycle of jack pines and other conifers in the Canadian boreal forest.",FAIL,RAGTruth

",why am i not getting a toned body if i do extersice every day,"Based on the given passages, it seems that having a toned body is dependent on two main factors: having muscle mass and having a low enough body fat percentage to reveal the muscle.

If you are exercising regularly but not seeing any improvements in your physique, there could be several reasons why. Here are a few possibilities:

1. Lack of proper nutrition: Exercise alone is not enough to achieve a toned body. You need to make sure you're consuming a balanced diet that provides your body with the necessary nutrients to build muscle and burn fat.
2. Insufficient rest and recovery: Muscles grow during rest and recovery, not during exercise. If you're not giving your body enough time to recover between workouts, you may not be allowing your muscles to fully repair and rebuild, which can hinder your progress.
3. Inconsistent training: Consistency is key when it comes to building muscle and achieving a toned body. If you're not exercising regularly or consistently, you may not be making the gains you desire.
4. Lack of progressive overload: Progressive overload refers to gradually increasing the intensity of your workouts over time to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth. If you're not challenging yourself enough, you may not be making the gains you want.
5. Poor form and technique: If you're not using proper form and technique during your workouts, you may not be targeting the muscles effectively, which can hinder your progress.

Nonessential amino acids can be made by the body, while essential amino acids cannot be made by the body so you must get them from your diet.

",what is the difference between essential and nonessential amino acids,"The main difference between essential and non-essential amino acids is that the human body cannot produce essential amino acids on its own and therefore must obtain them from the diet, whereas non-essential amino acids can either be produced by the body or obtained from the diet. Essential amino acids are also referred to as ""limiting"" amino acids, meaning that the body cannot synthesize them and thus they must be obtained from outside sources. In contrast, non-essential amino acids are considered ""dispensable"" because the body can either synthesize them or obtain them from the diet.

Essential amino acids are vital for various bodily functions such as protein synthesis, tissue repair, and muscle growth. There are nine essential amino acids that humans need to consume regularly: valine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and histidine (which is only essential for infants). Non-essential amino acids, on the other hand, are still important for various physiological processes, but the body can produce them independently or obtain them from the diet.

With that said, here are a few cases when pie charts work best: 1  When you have only a few data points to display, and each one is substantially different in scale.he y-axis will have a scale, and each bar’s height should be proportionate to the size of the category it represents. This can create a problem if you have very disproportionate responses that impact the scale of your graph, so keep that in mind when formatting.

",show me how can i make gragh for my research,"Based on the given passages, here are the steps to create a bar graph for your research:

1. Collect your data: Before creating a bar graph, you need to collect all the data you will be using for the graph. Make sure the data is relevant and relates to the purpose of your research.
2. Determine the categories: Identify the categories you will be comparing in your bar graph. These categories should be represented by the different bars in your graph.
3. Choose a scale: Decide on the scale you will use for the y-axis (vertical axis) of your graph. Each bar's height should be proportionate to the size of the category it represents.
4. Title your graph: Give your graph a clear and descriptive title that reflects the topic of your research.
5. Create your graph: Use graph paper to create your bar graph. Each bar should represent one category, and the height of each bar should be proportional to the value of that category. Make sure to label each bar with the name of the category it represents.
6. Add a key: Include a key or legend to explain the meaning of each bar. This will help your audience understand the data displayed in your graph.
7. Finalize your graph: Once you have created your graph, review it to ensure that the scales are accurate and the labels are clear. Make any necessary adjustments before presenting your graph.

Remember, a bar graph is a great way to compare different categories and show their relationships. It is important to choose appropriate scales and labels to ensure that your graph is easy to read and understand.",FAIL,RAGTruth

2. Hormonal changes: Hormonal fluctuations in the body can lead to oily skin, especially during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause.
3. Poor hygiene and topical applications: Using heavy or oily cosmetic products, not washing the face regularly, and not removing makeup properly can contribute to oily skin.

It is important to note that diet does not significantly affect oily skin, and popular beliefs about certain foods increasing oil production are not supported by evidence.",FAIL,RAGTruth

Notwithstanding, knowledge about the target genes mediating its biological and pathological functions remains limited. We therefore aimed to identify and characterize novel EVI1 target genes in human myeloid cells.
U937T_EVI1, a human myeloid cell line expressing EVI1 in a tetracycline regulable manner, was subjected to gene expression profiling. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the regulation of membrane-spanning-4-domains subfamily-A member-3 (MS4A3) by EVI1. Reporter constructs containing various parts of the MS4A3 upstream region were employed in luciferase assays, and binding of EVI1 to the MS4A3 promoter was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. U937 derivative cell lines experimentally expressing EVI1 and/or MS4A3 were generated by retroviral transduction, and tested for their tumorigenicity by subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficient mice.
Gene expression microarray analysis identified 27 unique genes that were up-regulated, and 29 unique genes that were down-regulated, in response to EVI1 induction in the human myeloid cell line U937T. The most strongly repressed gene was MS4A3, and its down-regulation by EVI1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR in additional, independent experimental model systems. MS4A3 mRNA levels were also negatively correlated with those of EVI1 in several published AML data sets. Reporter gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that EVI1 regulated MS4A3 via direct binding to a promoter proximal region. Experimental re-expression of MS4A3 in an EVI1 overexpressing cell line counteracted the tumor promoting effect of EVI1 in a murine xenograft model by increasing the rate of apoptosis.",Does eVI1 promote tumor growth via transcriptional repression of MS4A3?,"Yes.

1155,19357361,"Identifying the cues required for the survival and development of photoreceptors is essential for treating retinal neurodegeneration. The authors previously established that glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulates proliferation and that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) promotes photoreceptor survival and differentiation. Later findings that ceramide triggers photoreceptor apoptosis suggested sphingolipids might also control photoreceptor development. The present study investigated whether sphingosine-1-phophate (S1P), which promotes survival and differentiation in several cell types, regulates photoreceptor proliferation and differentiation and whether it is a mediator in GDNF and DHA effects.
Rat retina neuronal cultures were supplemented at day 0 or 1 with S1P, GDNF, or DHA and were treated with DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine to inhibit S1P synthesis or with brefeldin A (BFA) to block intracellular trafficking. Proliferation was quantified to determine bromodeoxyuridine uptake and number of mitotic figures. Opsin, peripherin, and sphingosine kinase (SphK), the enzyme required for S1P synthesis, were quantified by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis.
S1P increased the proliferation of photoreceptor progenitors. It also stimulated the formation of apical processes, enhanced opsin and peripherin expression, and promoted their localization in these processes; DHA had similar effects. BFA prevented S1P and DHA enhancement of apical process formation without affecting opsin expression. GDNF and DHA enhanced SphK expression in photoreceptors, while inhibiting S1P synthesis blocked GDNF mitogenic effects and DHA effects on differentiation.",Is sphingosine-1-phosphate a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in retina photoreceptors?,"Yes. The authors propose S1P as a key regulator in photoreceptor development.

We over-expressed DREF in the wing imaginal disc using a GAL4-UAS targeted expression system in Drosophila. Over-expression of DREF induced a notching wing phenotype, which was associated with ectopic apoptosis. A half reduction of the reaper, head involution defective and grim gene dose suppressed this DREF-induced notching wing phenotype. Furthermore, this was also the case with co-expression of baculovirus P35, a caspase inhibitor. In addition, over-expression of the 32 kDa boundary element-associated factor (BEAF-32), thought to compete against DREF for common binding sites in genomic regions, rescued the DREF-induced notching wing phenotype, while a half reduction of the genomic region, including the BEAF-32 gene, exerted enhancing effects.

Tumor cell growth with the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin was measured in the presence or absence of HA, anti-CD44 antibody plus HA, and other inhibitors of the PLC-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway. Ca2+ mobilization was measured with fluorescence spectrophotometry using the Ca2+ binding dye Fura/2AM.
In the absence of HA, cisplatin inhibited tumor cell growth. The addition of HA, but not HA plus anti-CD44 antibody, resulted in a 5-fold reduced ability of cisplatin to cause HNSCC cell death, suggesting that HA can promote CD44-dependent cisplatin resistance.

HDL particle sizes were determined by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Serum concentrations of human HDL constituents were measured immunoturbidometrically or enzymatically.
miR-16, miR-17, miR-126, miR-222 and miR-223 were present on HDL from overweight and obese subjects at baseline and after 12 weeks of the HP and NP weight loss diets. The HP diet induced a significant decrease in HDL-associated miR-223 levels (p = 0.015), which positively correlated with changes in body weight (r = 0.488, p = 0.032). Changes in miR-223 levels were not associated to changes in HDL composition or size.",Does high-Density Lipoprotein-Associated miR-223 be Altered after Diet-Induced Weight Loss in Overweight and Obese Males?,Yes.

1495,12145808,"Immunogenetic analysis of experimental colitis may contribute to the further unraveling of the complex genetic basis of the inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
Genetic regions associated with susceptibility to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis were identified in a genome-wide linkage analysis in F2 progeny of colitis-susceptible SJL/J and -resistant C57BL/6 mice. An immunogenetic approach was then used to further study the pathophysiologic role of one of the identified loci.
We identified susceptibility loci on chromosomes 9 (Tnbs1) and 11 (Tnbs2). Tnbs2 harbors the interleukin (IL)-12 p40 gene, a likely candidate gene because IL-12 is a known central mediator for both experimental colitis and human Crohn's disease. We therefore tested the ability of colitis-susceptible and -resistant strains to mount IL-12 responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a strong inducer of IL-12 that is abundantly present in the intestine. We observed a remarkably higher serum IL-12 response to LPS in susceptible SJL/J mice. Subsequently, we showed that the genetic region regulating the IL-12 response to LPS colocalizes with Tnbs2.","Is experimental murine colitis regulated by two genetic loci , including one on chromosome 11 that regulates IL-12 responses?",Yes. These data strongly suggest that the tendency to mount a high LPS-induced IL-12 response and susceptibility to TNBS-induced colitis are related and that in fact a genetically determined high IL-12 response is involved in the immunologic basis of susceptibility to colitis.,PASS,pubmedQA

In this study, we investigated the influence of cytokine gene polymorphisms (TNFα, TGFβ, IL10 and IFNγ) on frequency, risk group and prognosis in 95 paediatric ALL-patients. We further report on intracellular production of these cytokines in T-cells.
IL10 high-producer-haplotypes were reduced in ALL-patients compared with healthy controls and resulted in a reduced relapse rate compared with low-producer haplotypes. TGFβ high-producer-haplotypes were correlated with a high initial blast-count (codon 25: G/G) and were elevated in high-risk ALL-patients (codon 10: T/T). IL10 was positively and IFNγ-production was negatively correlated with initial blast-count. At diagnosis the expression of TNFα and IFNγ was reduced in patients compared with healthy controls. This was more pronounced in high-risk and in T-ALL-patients.",Do tGFβ and IL10 have an impact on risk group and prognosis in childhood ALL?,"Yes. We conclude that gene-polymorphisms of the regulatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, TGFβ and IL10, but not of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFNγ and TNFα, have an impact on prognosis and risk-group of ALL. However, the reduced capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines at diagnosis may serve as another important, functional risk factor.

1491,16680498,"It remains uncertain whether long-term participation in regular weight-bearing exercise confers an advantage to bone structure and strength in old age. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation on bone material and structural properties at the axial and appendicular skeleton in older men (>50 years).
We used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess hip, spine and ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD) (n=161), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality (n=161), and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine (L(1)-L(3)) and mid-femur (n=111). Current (>50+ years) and past hours of sport and leisure activity participation during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50 years) were assessed by questionnaire. This information was used to calculate the total time (min) spent participating in sport and leisure activities and an osteogenic index (OI) score for each participant, which provides a measure of participation in weight-bearing activities.
Regression analysis revealed that a greater lifetime (13-50+ years) and mid-adulthood (19-50 years) OI, but not total time (min), was associated with a greater mid-femur total and cortical area, cortical bone mineral content (BMC), and the polar moment of inertia (I (p)) and heel VOS (p ranging from <0.05 to <0.01). These results were independent of age, height (or femoral length) and weight (or muscle cross-sectional area). Adolescent OI scores were not found to be significant predictors of bone structure or strength. Furthermore, no significant relationships were detected with areal or volumetric BMD at any site. Subjects were then categorized into either a high (H) or low/non-impact (L) group during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50+ years) according to their OI scores during each of these periods. Three groups were subsequently formed to reflect weight-bearing impact categories during adolescence and then adulthood: LL, HL and HH. Compared to the LL group, mid-femur total and cortical area, cortical BMC and I (p) were 6.5-14.2% higher in the HH group. No differences were detected between the LL and HL groups.","Is lifetime sport and leisure activity participation associated with greater bone size , quality and strength in older men?","Yes. In conclusion, these findings indicate that long-term regular participation in sport and leisure activities categorized according to an osteogenic index [but not the total time (min) spent participating in all sport and leisure activities] was an important determinant of bone size, quality and strength, but not BMD, at loaded sites in older men. Furthermore, continued participation in weight-bearing exercise in early to mid-adulthood appears to be important for reducing the risk of low bone strength in old age.",PASS,pubmedQA

After intravenous injection of 7.77 MBq (0.21 mCi) of (18)F-FDG per kilogram, a standard whole-body CT study (80-110 s) and PET emission scan were acquired for 4 min/bed position in 49 patients and 3 min/bed position in 8 patients. One-minute-per-bed-position data were then extracted from the 3- or 4-min/bed position scans to reconstruct single-minute/bed position scans for each patient.

Follow up study of mortality in relation to employment grade and car ownership over 25 years.
The first Whitehall study.
18,133 male civil servants aged 40-69 years who attended a screening examination between 1967 and 1970.
Death.
Grade of employment was a strong predictor of mortality before retirement. For men dying at ages 40-64 the lowest employment grade had 3.12 times the mortality of the highest grade (95% confidence interval 2.4 to 4.1). After retirement the ability of grade to predict mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal magnitude after retirement. The absolute difference in death rates between the lowest and highest employment grades increased with age from 12.9 per 1000 person years at ages 40-64 to 38.3 per 1000 at ages 70-89.",Do socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement?,Yes. Socioeconomic differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase with age. Social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on a non-work measure.

1461,21663658,"Paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) plays a crucial role in morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and somitogenesis in mouse, zebrafish and Xenopus. PAPC influences cell-cell adhesion mediated by C-Cadherin. A putative direct adhesion activity of PAPC is discussed. PAPC also promotes cell elongation, tissue separation and coordinates cell mass movements. In these processes the signaling function of PAPC in activating RhoA/JNK and supporting Wnt-11/PCP by binding to frizzled 7 (fz7) is important.
Here we demonstrate by loss of function experiments in Xenopus embryos that PAPC regulates another type of morphogenetic movement, the invagination of the ear placode. Knockdown of PAPC by antisense morpholinos results in deformation of the otic vesicle without altering otocyst marker expression. Depletion of PAPC could be rescued by full-length PAPC, constitutive active RhoA and by the closely related PCNS but not by classical cadherins. Also the cytoplasmic deletion mutant M-PAPC, which influences cell adhesion, does not rescue the PAPC knockdown. Interestingly, depletion of Wnt5a or Ror2 which are also expressed in the otocyst phenocopies the PAPC morphant phenotype.",Do pAPC and the Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway control the invagination of the otic placode in Xenopus?,Yes. PAPC signaling via RhoA and Wnt5a/Ror2 activity are required to keep cells aligned in apical-basal orientation during invagination of the ear placode. Since neither the cytoplasmic deletion mutant M-PAPC nor a classical cadherin is able to rescue loss of PAPC we suggest that the signaling function of the protocadherin rather than its role as modulator of cell-cell adhesion is required during invagination of the ear placode.,PASS,pubmedQA

Population-based PCa screening includes prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement with or without a DRE. PSA and DRE screening provide greater sensitivity than PSA alone; however, the increased participation rate resulting from PSA-alone screening may result in a greater detection rate.
We performed a survey of 13,580 healthy men undergoing PSA-only population-based screening. In addition to the basic demographic information, the survey asked whether the participant would still be willing to participate in the screening if it included a DRE. We modeled the willingness to participate to assess the effect of PSA screening versus PSA and DRE screening on the basis of previously published data and our results.
The results of our study indicated that only 78% of men would participate in screening that included both DRE and PSA. Thus, 7800 men of a theoretical population of 10,000 would participate in a screening that included both DRE and PSA. The positive screen rate (PSA > or = 4.0 ng/mL and/or abnormal DRE) would then have been 2013, with 472 PCa cases and 1540 negative biopsies. In the PSA-alone arm, all 10,000 men would have agreed to participate, and the positive screen rate (PSA > or = 4.0 ng/mL) would have been 1480, with 499 PCa cases and 980 negative biopsies. The PSA-alone arm would thus have detected 27 more cancers and performed 560 fewer negative biopsies.",Is digital rectal examination barrier to population-based prostate cancer screening?,"Yes. The results of our study have demonstrated that DRE is a significant barrier to participation in PCa screening.

We examined the Ab responses in aviremic RMs that had been immunized with a multi-component protein vaccine (multimeric HIV-1 gp160, HIV-1 Tat and SIV Gag-Pol particles) and compared anti-Env plasma Ab titers before and after repeated live-virus exposures. Although no viremia was ever detected in these animals, they showed significant increases in anti-gp140 Ab titers after they had encountered live SHIVs. When we investigated the dynamics of anti-Env Ab titers during the immunization and challenge phases further, we detected the expected, vaccine-induced increases of Ab responses about two weeks after the last protein immunization. Remarkably, these titers kept rising during the repeated virus challenges, although no viremia resulted. In contrast, in vaccinated RMs that were not exposed to virus, anti-gp140 Ab titers declined after the peak seen two weeks after the last immunization. These data suggest boosting of pre-existing, vaccine-induced Ab responses as a consequence of repeated live-virus exposures. Next, we screened polyclonal plasma samples from two of the completely protected vaccinees by peptide phage display and designed a strategy that selects for recombinant phages recognized only by Abs present after - but not before - any SHIV challenge. With this ""subtractive biopanning"" approach, we isolated V3 mimotopes that were only recognized after the animals had been exposed to live virus.

Patients were followed up with colonoscopy every other month until complete response or treatment completion, and then every 6 months for 1 year and annually. Complete response was defined as a resolution of symptoms and active tuberculosis by colonoscopy.
Complete response was obtained in all patients in both groups. Two patients in the 9-month group and one in the 15-month group underwent operation due to intestinal obstruction and perianal fistula, respectively. No recurrence of active intestinal tuberculosis occurred during the follow-up period in either group.",Is a 9-month treatment sufficient in tuberculous enterocolitis?,Yes. Tuberculous enterocolitis can be managed by 9-month chemotherapy without disease recurrence. Further investigations are needed in immunocompromised patients.,PASS,pubmedQA
1333,25481622,"Hunger enhances sensitivity to reward, yet individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) are not motivated to eat when starved. This study investigated brain response to rewards during hunger and satiated states to examine whether diminished response to reward could underlie food restriction in AN.
Using a delay discounting monetary decision task known to discriminate brain regions contributing to processing of immediate rewards and cognitive control important for decision making regarding future rewards, we compared 23 women remitted from AN (RAN group; to reduce the confounding effects of starvation) with 17 healthy comparison women (CW group). Monetary rewards were used because the rewarding value of food may be confounded by anxiety in AN.
Interactions of Group (RAN, CW) × Visit (hunger, satiety) revealed that, for the CW group, hunger significantly increased activation in reward salience circuitry (ventral striatum, dorsal caudate, anterior cingulate cortex) during processing of immediate reward, whereas satiety increased activation in cognitive control circuitry (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula) during decision making. In contrast, brain response in reward and cognitive neurocircuitry did not differ during hunger and satiety in the RAN group. A main effect of group revealed elevated response in the middle frontal gyrus for the RAN group compared with the CW group.",Does hunger motivate reward in women remitted from anorexia nervosa?,No. Women remitted from AN failed to increase activation of reward valuation circuitry when hungry and showed elevated response in cognitive control circuitry independent of metabolic state. Decreased sensitivity to the motivational drive of hunger may explain the ability of individuals with AN to restrict food when emaciated. Difficulties in valuating emotional salience may contribute to inabilities to appreciate the risks inherent in this disorder.,PASS,pubmedQA
1409,20677338,"To investigate and elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying varioliform gastritis for early detection, prevention and intervention of gastric cancer.
A combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry was used to detect the differentially expressed proteins between varioliform gastritis and matched normal mucosa. The selected proteins were confirmed by Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in additional samples and the function of some proteins in varioliform gastritis was analyzed by bio-method preliminarily.
We identified 21 differentially expressed proteins in varioliform gastritis, and compared them with matched normal mucosa. Eleven proteins were upregulated and ten downregulated in varioliform gastritis when compared with the same proteins in individual-matched normal gastric mucosa. These proteins are related to metabolism, oxidation, cytoskeleton, apoptosis, signal transduction and other aspects of cells. Two novel proteins, thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 (TXNDC5) upregulated in varioliform gastritis, and neuropolypeptide h3 [phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1)] downregulated in varioliform gastritis, were further investigated. Their expressions were validated by Western blotting and RT-PCR in 12 cases of varioliform gastritis which was matched with normal mucosa. The expression level of PEBP1 in varioliform gastritis was significantly lower (P < 0.05) while that of TXNDC5 was significantly higher than that in matched normal gastric mucosa (P < 0.05).",Does proteomic analysis reveal molecular biological details in varioliform gastritis without Helicobacter pylori infection?,Yes.

In addition, HGF is now produced under a good manufacturing practice (GMP) procedure. Therefore, human clinical trials of HGF are warranted in patients with vocal fold scarring. In the current study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and the local tissue responses of HGF administered to rat vocal folds.
Prospective animal experiment.
Five μg of recombinant human HGF was administered to the vocal folds of Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 60) using a microsyringe. The concentration of HGF in larynges and blood was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To evaluate the local tissue responses caused by HGF administration, endoscopic and histological examinations were performed.
HGF concentration in the larynges was 50.1 μg/g tissue 5 minutes after administration. The concentration decreased rapidly to 1.71 μg/g tissue at 12 hours after administration and to 0.29 ng/g tissue at 24 hours after administration. Seven days after administration, HGF concentration was minimal in one-half of the cases and was not detected in the other cases.

Cohort study.
VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
Twenty-one prepubertal healthy children showing a wide range in birth weight.
Birth weight data were obtained from hospital records. Blood pressure was measured with an ambulatory 24-h blood pressure monitor, and insulin sensitivity was assessed with the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp technique. Microvascular function (i.e. capillary recruitment during post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia and endothelium (in)dependent vasodilatation of the skin) was evaluated by videomicroscopy and iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside.
Birth weight was positively and significantly associated with capillary recruitment [slope, 22%/kg birth weight; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.1-43; 0.05]. Birth weight was not associated with insulin sensitivity and systolic blood pressure (slope, -0.11 mg/kg per min per pmol/l; 95% CI, -2.4 to 2.2; = 0.9; and slope, 1.4 mmHg; 95% CI, -5.0 to 7.7/kg birth weight; = 0.7, respectively).

All referrals to the breast MDT where breast cancer was diagnosed from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2011 were included. Multidisciplinary team decisions were compared with subsequent patient management and classified as concordant or discordant.
Over the study period, there were 3230 MDT decisions relating to 705 patients. Overall, 91.5% (2956 out of 3230) of decisions were concordant, 4.5% (146 out of 3230), were discordant and 4% (128 out of 3230) had no MDT decision. Of 146 discordant decisions, 26 (17.8%) were considered 'unjustifiable' as there was no additional information available after the MDT to account for the change in management.

Seventeen clinical MDR tuberculosis (TB) strains were characterized by standard and semi-quantitative drug susceptibility testing to assess the level of isoniazid and ethionamide resistance. The genes katG, inhA, ethA and ndh were screened for mutations. All strains were genotyped by 24 loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) analysis.
All strains showed high-level resistance to both isoniazid (>1 mg/L) and ethionamide (>25 mg/L). MIRU-VNTR typing revealed the presence of two main clusters, Lisboa3 and Q1, in 16/17 strains, all of which showed the C-15T mutation in the promoter region of the inhA gene. The 16 strains belong to the Latino-American-Mediterranean (LAM) genotype and the other strain belongs to the Beijing genotype.

Nevertheless, the rate of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic tail resection does not differ between various techniques, still reaching up to 30% in prospective multicentric studies. Taking into account contradictory results concerning the usefulness of covering resection margins after distal pancreatectomy, we sought to perform a systematic, retrospective analysis of patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy at our center.
We retrospectively analysed the data of 74 patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy between 2001 and 2011 at the community hospital in Neuss. Demographic factors, indications, postoperative complications, surgical or interventional revisions, and length of hospital stay were registered to compare the outcome of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy with coverage of the resection margins vs. patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy without coverage of the resection margins. Differences between groups were calculated using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test.
Main indications for pancreatic surgery were insulinoma (n=18, 24%), ductal adenocarcinoma (n=9, 12%), non-single-insulinoma-pancreatogenic-hypoglycemia-syndrome (NSIPHS) (n=8, 11%), and pancreatic cysts with pancreatitis (n=8, 11%).

Serum SDC-1 levels were higher in patients with SLE than in those with RA and healthy controls (both p < 0.001) and were positively correlated with SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI; r = 0.367, p < 0.001) and anti-dsDNA antibody level (r = 0.259, p = 0.007), but inversely correlated with serum C3 and CH50 levels (r = -0.305, p = 0.001 and r = -0.244, p = 0.012). Patients with active nephritis had higher serum SDC-1 levels than patients with inactive nephritis and those without nephritis (both p < 0.001). In addition, serum SDC-1 levels were correlated with renal SLEDAI score (r = 0.540, p < 0.001) and excretion of proteinuria as measured by spot urine protein/creatinine ratio (r = 0.538, p < 0.001). In 14 patients with lupus nephritis (LN) whose serum samples were obtained at the time of renal biopsy, there was a positive correlation between serum SDC-1 levels and activity index (r = 0.632, p = 0.015).",Are elevated serum levels of syndecan-1 associated with renal involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus?,"Yes.

Determine whether obesity or increasing level of body mass index (BMI) are associated with worse asthma control in an ethnically diverse urban population.
Cross-sectional assessment of asthma control was performed in patients with asthma recruited from primary care offices by using 4 different validated asthma control questionnaires: the Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (ACCI), the Asthma Control Test (ACT), the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), and the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between obesity and increasing BMI level and asthma control.
Of 292 subjects with a mean age of 47 years, the majority were women (82%) and African American (67%). There was a high prevalence of obesity with 63%, with only 15% normal weight. The mean score from all 4 questionnaires showed an average suboptimal asthma control (mean score/maximum possible score): ACCI (8.3/19), ACT (15.4/25), ACQ (2.1/6), and ATAQ (1.3/4).

1148,25645291,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer. However, how Notch signaling regulates the EMT process and invasion in breast cancer remains largely unknown.
The impact of Notch1 silencing by specific shRNAs on the EMT and invasion of human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells as well as xenografts was tested by western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, transwell, and immunohistochemistry assays. The effect of Slug silencing or upregulation on the EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells was analyzed, and the effect of Notch1 signaling on Slug expression was determined by the luciferase reporter assay.
The Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) and Jagged1 were expressed in breast cancer cells. Notch1 silencing reversed the spontaneous EMT process and inhibited the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and the growth of xenograft breast cancers. The expression of N1ICD was upregulated significantly by Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling activation. Moreover, Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling promoted the EMT process, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells, which were abrogated by Notch silencing. Furthermore, the N1ICD positively regulated the Slug expression by inducing Slug promoter activation. Importantly, the knockdown of Slug weakened the invasion ability of breast cancer cells and reversed the Jagged1-induced EMT process with significantly decreased expression of vimentin and increased expression of E-cadherin. In addition, Slug overexpression restored the Notch1 knockdown-suppressed EMT process.",Does notch1 signaling regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion of breast cancer in a Slug-dependent manner?,"Yes. Our novel data indicate that Notch signaling positively regulates the EMT, invasion, and growth of breast cancer cells by inducing Slug expression.

To investigate the prognosis, assessed by eczema, job status and skin-related quality of life, among patients allergic to rubber chemicals and latex (ubiquitous allergens) and epoxy (nonubiquitous allergen), 2 years after recognition of occupational allergic contact dermatitis.
From a cohort of all patients recognized as having occupational dermatitis by the Danish National Board of Industrial Injuries in 2010, 199 patients with relevant rubber allergy (contact allergy to rubber chemicals or contact urticaria from latex) or epoxy allergy were identified. Follow-up consisted of a questionnaire covering current severity of eczema, employment, exposure and quality of life.
The response rate was 75%. Clearance of eczema was reported by 11% of patients and 67% reported improvement. Overall 22% of patients with allergy to a nonubiquitous allergen had total clearance of eczema compared with 10% of cases allergic to ubiquitous allergens and 0% of those with contact urticaria (P = 0·116).

Using the computerized database of the largest health care provider in Israel, we identified a cohort of subjects 20 years old or older with serum 25(OH)D levels measured between January 2008 and December 2009. Vital status was ascertained through August 2011.
Median follow-up was 28.5 months (interquartile range 23.8-33.5 months); 7,247 of 182,152 participants (4.0%) died. Subjects who died had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels (mean 44.8 ± 24.2 nmol/liter) than those alive at the end of follow-up (51.0 ± 23.2 nmol/liter), P < 0.001.

After assisted reproductive technology (ART), previous studies have shown elevated C-section rates but few studies differentiated between elective and emergency operations and different protocols of cryopreservation. Because these studies did not use multiparity as exclusion criteria which reduces confounding with previous pregnancies, aim of this study is to compare mode of delivery of different techniques of ART using data of primiparae only [1, 2].
Retrospective analysis of patient data treated at the university hospital of Luebeck in a period of 12 years. Patients were divided in different groups according to their way of conception: spontaneous conception and conception after ART.

1262,18193068,"ZP120 (Ac-RYYRWKKKKKKK-NH(2)), is a new partial nociceptin/orphanin FQ (NOP) receptor agonist with sodium-potassium sparing aquaretic effects. The mechanisms of vasodilatation of ZP120 were examined in rat mesenteric resistance arteries.
Arterial segments (internal diameters 206+/-4 microm, n=224) were mounted in microvascular myographs for isometric tension recordings and electrical field stimulation (EFS).
ZP120 and the endogenous NOP receptor ligand, N/OFQ, did not relax arteries contracted with noradrenaline or adenosine-triphosphate. EFS-evoked contractions were inhibited by a purinoceptor antagonist, suramin, and the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. N/OFQ inhibited, concentration-dependently, EFS-evoked contractions with a maximal effect of 52+/-3% (n=8) at 1 microM. The maximal effect of 1 microM ZP120 was lower (27+/-5%, P<0.05, n=9) than for N/OFQ. Endothelial removal or pretreatment with capsaicin did not influence the vasodilator effects of ZP120 and N/OFQ. ZP120 and N/OFQ responses were preserved in the presence of suramin. The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine, antagonized the effect of clonidine and brimonidine, but ZP120 and N/OFQ inhibition of EFS-evoked contraction was unaltered. The competitive NOP receptor antagonist, UFP-101 (10 microM), prevented the inhibitory effect of N/OFQ, but not ZP120 suggesting that N/OFQ and ZP120 have distinct modes of interaction with the NOP receptor.",Does zP120 cause relaxation by pre-junctional inhibition of noradrenergic neurotransmission in rat mesenteric resistance arteries?,"Yes.

Sensitivity to X-ray irradiation of these cell lines was determined with a colony survival assay. The suppression of GRP94 expression was performed using specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) in HeLa and Caski cells.
HeLa cells and QG-U cells, with higher basal levels of GRP94, exhibited a low sensitivity to X-ray cell killing. In HeLa cells, the sensitivity increased when protein GRP94 levels were reduced by specific siRNA transfection.

The base-case analysis was patients with active Crohn's disease who are naïve to both medications (similar to those in SONIC) who were treated for 1 year. We used sensitivity analyses to determine the thresholds at which the risks of side effects from IFX/AZA outweigh its benefits.
During 1 year, the benefits of IFX/AZA would outweigh the risks, unless serious infections occurred in 20% or more of the population or lymphoma in 3.9% or more. These thresholds are 5-fold and 65-fold higher than base-case estimates, respectively.",Do adverse events outweigh benefits of combination therapy for Crohn 's disease in a decision analytic model?,"No. On the basis of data from 1 year of SONIC, the combination of IFX/AZA was more effective than IFX alone in patients with Crohn's disease who are naïve to either drug. For the risks of combination therapy to outweigh the benefits in this time frame, the incidence of serious adverse events would have to be higher than seems clinically realistic.",PASS,pubmedQA
1290,25862596,"To examine the association between early menarche and risk of post-menarcheal asthma.
Using data from two multidisciplinary questionnaire surveys, conducted eight years apart, we prospectively studied 10,648 female twins, 12-41 years of age, from the nationwide Danish Twin Registry. Early menarche was defined as menarche before 12 years of age. We performed a cohort analysis and a co-twin control analysis including twin pairs discordant for incident asthma.
Early menarche was observed in 9.3% of the individuals. The eight-year cumulative incidence of asthma was higher in girls with early menarche compared to girls without early menarche (7.4 vs. 4.5%), OR = 1.71 (1.31-2.22), p < 0.001; also after adjustment for BMI, current age, physical activity, education, and smoking, OR = 1.53 (1.15-2.04), p = 0.003. The unadjusted risk of asthma was increased by 8% (1-15%), p = 0.041 per year earlier menarche occurred. Among 167 twin pairs discordant for incident asthma, there was a non-significant tendency towards early menarche being more common in the asthmatic than the non-asthmatic co-twin (12.0 vs. 9.6%), OR = 1.57 (0.61-4.05), p = 0.350. The risk of asthma was not uniform in discordant monozygotic and dizygotic twins.",Is early menarche associated with increased risk of asthma : Prospective population-based study of twins?,"Yes.

1317,25589556,"High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a heterogeneous population of particles. Differences in the capacities of HDL subfractions to remove cellular cholesterol may explain variable correlations between HDL-cholesterol and cardiovascular risk and inform future targets for HDL-related therapies. The ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) facilitates cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I, but the majority of apolipoprotein A-I in the circulation is transported in a lipidated state and ABCA1-dependent efflux to individual HDL subfractions has not been systematically studied.
Our aims were to determine which HDL particle subfractions are most efficient in mediating cellular cholesterol efflux from foam cell macrophages and to identify the cellular cholesterol transporters involved in this process.
We used reconstituted HDL particles of defined size and composition, isolated subfractions of human plasma HDL, cell lines stably expressing ABCA1 or ABCG1, and both mouse and human macrophages in which ABCA1 or ABCG1 expression was deleted. We show that ABCA1 is the major mediator of macrophage cholesterol efflux to HDL, demonstrating most marked efficiency with small, dense HDL subfractions (HDL3b and HDL3c). ABCG1 has a lesser role in cholesterol efflux and a negligible role in efflux to HDL3b and HDL3c subfractions.",Is hDL particle size a critical determinant of ABCA1-mediated macrophage cellular cholesterol export?,"Yes. Small, dense HDL subfractions are the most efficient mediators of cholesterol efflux, and ABCA1 mediates cholesterol efflux to small dense HDL and to lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I. HDL-directed therapies should target increasing the concentrations or the cholesterol efflux capacity of small, dense HDL species in vivo.",PASS,pubmedQA
1304,11509232,"During Drosophila embryogenesis, Jun kinase (JNK) signaling has been shown to play a key role in regulating the morphogenetic process of dorsal closure, which also serves as a model for epithelial sheet fusion during wound repair. During dorsal closure the JNK signaling cascade in the dorsal-most (leading edge) cells of the epidermis activates the AP-1 transcription factor comprised of DJUN and DFOS that, in turn, upregulates the expression of the dpp gene. DPP is a secreted morphogen that signals lateral epidermal cells to elongate along the dorsoventral axis. The leading edge cells contact the peripheral cells of a monolayer extraembryonic epithelium, the amnioserosa, which lies on the dorsal side of the embryo. Focal complexes are present at the dorsal-most membrane of the leading edge cells, where they contact the amnioserosa.
We show that the JNK signaling cascade is initially active in both the amnioserosa and the leading edge of the epidermis. JNK signaling is downregulated in the amnioserosa, but not in the leading edge, prior to dorsal closure. The subcellular localization of DFOS and DJUN is responsive to JNK signaling in the amnioserosa: JNK activation results in nuclear localization of DFOS and DJUN; the downregulation of JNK signaling results in the relocalization of DFOS and DJUN to the cytoplasm. The HINDSIGHT (HNT) Zn-finger protein and the PUCKERED (PUC) JNK phosphatase are essential for downregulation of the JNK cascade in the amnioserosa. Persistent JNK activity in the amnioserosa leads to defective focal complexes in the adjacent leading edge cells and to the failure of dorsal closure.",Is downregulation of Jun kinase signaling in the amnioserosa essential for dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo?,"Yes. Focal complexes are assembled at the boundary between high and low JNK activity. In the absence of focal complexes, miscommunication between the amnioserosa and the leading edge may lead to a premature ""stop"" signal that halts dorsalward migration of the leading edge. Spatial and temporal regulation of the JNK signaling cascade may be a general mechanism that controls tissue remodeling during morphogenesis and wound healing.",PASS,pubmedQA
1268,24923251,"The opioid receptor family comprises four structurally homologous but functionally distinct sub-groups, the μ (MOP), δ (DOP), κ (KOP) and nociceptin (NOP) receptors. As most opioid agonists are selective but not specific, a broad spectrum of behaviours due to activation of different opioid receptors is expected. In this study, we examine whether other opioid receptor systems influenced KOP-mediated antinociception.
We used a tail withdrawal assay in C57Bl/6 mice to assay the antinociceptive effect of systemically administered opioid agonists with varying selectivity at KOP receptors. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to analyse the interactions of the other opioid receptors in modulating KOP-mediated antinociception.
Etorphine, a potent agonist at all four opioid receptors, was not anti-nociceptive in MOP knockout (KO) mice, although etorphine is an efficacious KOP receptor agonist and specific KOP receptor agonists remain analgesic in MOP KO mice. As KOP receptor agonists are aversive, we considered KOP-mediated antinociception might be a form of stress-induced analgesia that is blocked by the anxiolytic effects of DOP receptor agonists. In support of this hypothesis, pretreatment with the DOP antagonist, naltrindole (10 mg·kg(-1) ), unmasked etorphine (3 mg·kg(-1) ) antinociception in MOP KO mice. Further, in wild-type mice, KOP-mediated antinociception by systemic U50,488H (10 mg·kg(-1) ) was blocked by pretreatment with the DOP agonist SNC80 (5 mg·kg(-1) ) and diazepam (1 mg·kg(-1) ).",Is anti-nociception mediated by a κ opioid receptor agonist blocked by a δ receptor agonist?,"Yes. Systemic DOP receptor agonists blocked systemic KOP antinociception, and these results identify DOP receptor agonists as potential agents for reversing stress-driven addictive and depressive behaviours mediated through KOP receptor activation.",PASS,pubmedQA

Retrospective data analysis.
Three hundred fifty-three consecutive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who had a successful manual CPAP titration in our sleep disorders unit.
The mean optimal CPAP was 9.5 +/- 2.4 cm H2O. The optimal CPAP pressure increases with an increase in OSA severity from 7.79 +/- 2.2 in the mild, to 8.7 +/- 1.8 in the moderate, and to 10.1 +/- 2.3 cm H2O in the severe OSA group. A high CPAP was defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD;>or =12 cm H2O). The predictor variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables. The area under the receiver operator curve was 72.4%, showing that the model was adequate.",Does the severity of obstructive sleep apnea predict patients requiring high continuous positive airway pressure?,"Maybe. Severe OSA patients are much more likely to need high CPAP levels. However, because of the low positive predictive value (only 28.6%), the clinical value of such information is limited.

1455,18719439,"Many commonly used anesthetic agents produce a dose-dependent amplitude reduction and latency prolongation of evoked responses, which may impair diagnosis of intraoperative spinal cord injury. Dexmedetomidine is increasingly used as an adjunct for general anesthesia. Therefore, the authors tested the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine does not have a clinically important effect on somatosensory and transcranial motor evoked responses.
Thirty-seven patients were enrolled and underwent spinal surgery with instrumentation during desflurane and remifentanil anesthesia with dexmedetomidine as an anesthetic adjunct. Upper- and lower-extremity transcranial motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded during four defined periods: baseline without dexmedetomidine; two periods with dexmedetomidine (0.3 and 0.6 ng/ml), in a randomly determined order; and a final period 1 h after drug discontinuation. The primary outcomes were amplitude and latency of P37/N20, and amplitude, area under the curve, and voltage threshold for transcranial motor evoked potential stimulation.
Of the total, data from 30 patients were evaluated. Use of dexmedetomidine, as an anesthetic adjunct, did not have an effect on the latency or amplitude of sensory evoked potentials greater than was prespecified as clinically relevant, and though the authors were unable to claim equivalence on the amplitude of transcranial motor evoked responses due to variability, recordings were made throughout the study in all patients.",Are motor and somatosensory evoked potentials well maintained in patients given dexmedetomidine during spine surgery?,Yes.

Our aim is to the association of Ox-LDL with total bilirubin (TB) levels and with variables related with metabolic syndrome and inflammation, in young obese individuals.
125 obese patients (13.4 years; 53.6% females) were studied. TB, lipid profile including Ox-LDL, markers of glucose metabolism, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and adiponectin were determined. Anthropometric data was also collected. In all patients, Ox-LDL correlated positively with BMI, total cholesterol, LDLc, triglycerides (TG), CRP, glucose, insulin and HOMAIR; while inversely with TB and HDLc/Total cholesterol ratio (P < 0.05 for all).

1154,22647483,"Endothelial dysfunction (ED) participates to atherogenesis associated to rheumatoid arthritis. We recently reported increased arginase activity/expression in vessels from adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a curative treatment with the arginase inhibitor Nw-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (nor-NOHA) on vascular dysfunction in AIA rats.
AIA rats were treated with nor-NOHA (40 mg/kg/d, ip) for 21 days after the onset of arthritis. A group of untreated AIA rats and a group of healthy rats served as controls. ED was assessed by the vasodilatory effect of acetylcholine (Ach) on aortic rings. The role of superoxide anions, prostanoids, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway was studied. Plasma levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by ELISA kits. Arthritis severity was estimated by a clinical, radiological and histological analysis.
Nor-NOHA treatment fully restored the aortic response to Ach to that of healthy controls. The results showed that this beneficial effect is mediated by an increase in NOS activity and EDHF and reduced superoxide anion production as well as a decrease in the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, thromboxane and prostacyclins synthases. In addition, nor-NOHA decreased IL-6 and VEGF plasma levels in AIA rats. By contrast, the treatment did not modify arthritis severity in AIA rats.",Does treatment with the arginase inhibitor Nw-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine restore endothelial function in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis?,Yes.

We performed a structure-function analysis of the chitin-binding domains encoded by the chiA gene, which mediates the pathogenic effects of adherent invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC).
We created AIEC (strain LF82) with deletion of chiA (LF82-ΔchiA) or that expressed chiA with specific mutations. We investigated the effects of infecting different IEC lines with these bacteria compared with nonpathogenic E coli; chitinase activities were measured using the colloidal chitin-azure method. Colitis was induced in C57/Bl6 mice by administration of dextran sodium sulfate, and mice were given 10(8) bacteria for 15 consecutive days by gavage. Stool/tissue samples were collected and analyzed.
LF82-ΔchiA had significantly less adhesion to IEC lines than LF82. Complementation of LF82-ΔchiA with the LF82 chiA gene, but not chiA from nonpathogenic (K12) E coli, increased adhesion. We identified 5 specific polymorphisms in the chitin-binding domain of LF82 chiA (at amino acids 362, 370, 378, 388, and 548) that differ from chiA of K12 and were required for LF82 to interact directly with IECs. This interaction was mediated by an N-glycosylated asparagine in chitinase 3-like-1 (amino acid 68) on IECs.

In this study, we sought to identify clinically relevant histone deacetylases (HDACs) to guide the selection of HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) tailored to the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
HDAC expression in seven pancreatic cancer cell lines and normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells was determined by Western blotting. Antitumor interactions between class I- and class II-selective HDACIs were determined by MTT assays and standard isobologram/CompuSyn software analyses. The effects of HDACIs on cell death, apoptosis and cell cycle progression, and histone H4, alpha-tubulin, p21, and γH2AX levels were determined by colony formation assays, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blotting, respectively.
The majority of classes I and II HDACs were detected in the pancreatic cancer cell lines, albeit at variable levels. Treatments with MGCD0103 (a class I-selective HDACI) resulted in dose-dependent growth arrest, cell death/apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, accompanied by induction of p21 and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In contrast, MC1568 (a class IIa-selective HDACI) or Tubastatin A (a HDAC6-selective inhibitor) showed minimal effects. When combined simultaneously, MC1568 significantly enhanced MGCD0103-induced growth arrest, cell death/apoptosis, and G2/M cell cycle arrest, while Tubastatin A only synergistically enhanced MGCD0103-induced growth arrest.

We identified a 24-biomarker signature that enabled prediction of a positive clinical response to etanercept in all three cohorts (positive predictive values 58 to 72%; negative predictive values 63 to 78%).",Do blood autoantibody and cytokine profiles predict response to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in rheumatoid arthritis?,"Yes. We identified a multi-parameter protein biomarker that enables pretreatment classification and prediction of etanercept responders, and tested this biomarker using three independent cohorts of RA patients. Although further validation in prospective and larger cohorts is needed, our observations demonstrate that multiplex characterization of autoantibodies and cytokines provides clinical utility for predicting response to the anti-TNF therapy etanercept in RA patients.",PASS,pubmedQA
1472,18287809,"Effects of cannabinoids are mediated by CB1 and CB2 receptors. In addition to neuronal effects, cannabinoids are potent modulators of immune functions. In this report, we investigated whether the transcription of these receptors is regulated after activation of T lymphocytes.
CB1- and CB2-specific mRNA of primary human peripheral blood T cells and cells of the human T cell line Jurkat was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in response to CD3/28. Using the decoy oligonucleotide approach, transcription factors involved in the regulation were determined. A promoter analysis was performed using transient transfection of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene constructs in Jurkat cells.
Activation of human T cells caused an induction of CB1 mRNA expression in primary human T cells (8-fold) and Jurkat cells (29-fold). In contrast, CB2 transcription was not regulated. The CD3/28-mediated upregulation of CB1 involves the transcription factors AP-1, NF kappaB and NFAT. Furthermore, 2,490 bp of the CB1 promoter mediated inducibility in response to CD3/28.",Does activation of human T cells induce upregulation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 transcription?,"Yes. The upregulation of CB1 in activated T cells, together with the constitutive expression of CB2, enables cellular responses to cannabinoids mediated by both receptor subtypes. It may thus contribute to the understanding of the various modulatory effects of cannabinoids on activated T cells.",PASS,pubmedQA
1362,24836459,"Pathogenesis of early-onset preeclampsia (PE) is generally recognized by impaired trophoblast invasion of the myometrial arteries, which results in placental insufficiency. Recently, we reported that CDX1 is hypermethylated in the human preeclampsia placenta. However, whether CDX1 participates in trophoblast invasion has not been clearly elucidated.
We investigated the function of CDX1 in the extravillous trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo using stable transfection of CDX1. Using a CDX1 stable transfected cell line, we determined the cell invasion using a QCM ECMatrix 24-well kit. The cell viability was detected using an MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting analyses were performed to examine the changes in the expression of downstream target genes and proteins. To disrupt PI3K/AKT signaling, we used the PI3K inhibitor perifosine.
Cell invasion assays demonstrated that CDX1 restricts trophoblast cell invasiveness. In contrast, quantification of cumulative cell numbers revealed that CDX1 did not affect cell proliferation. Western blotting analysis and quantitative real time PCR demonstrated that MMP-9 expression was reduced, whereas TIMP-1 expression was increased in CDX1-overexpressed cells. However, overexpression of CDX1 did not affect PI3K/AKT signaling in HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells. In contrast, CDX1 was regulated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",Does cDX1 restrict the invasion of HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells by inhibiting MMP-9 expression?,"Yes. Altogether, we found that in trophoblast cells, CDX1 reduced invasion independently of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, CDX1 functions in concert with PI3K/AKT signaling to regulate trophoblast invasion. We concluded that CDX1 restricts the invasion of HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells by inhibiting MMP-9 expression independently of the PI3K/AKT pathway.",PASS,pubmedQA

Categorical loudness scaling (CLS) was conducted at three overall stimulation rates using single-electrode stimuli and multi-electrode stimuli presented interleaved on two or four electrodes. The specific loudness of the pulses in the multi-electrode stimuli were equalized based on single-electrode measurements at the same overall stimulation rate. At a fixed overall stimulation rate and a fixed loudness perception, SLS was calculated as the difference in mean current between single-electrode and multi-electrode stimuli.

The present study was to characterize pharmacologically the prostanoid receptors by investigating the effects of prostanoid receptor agonists on the immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated histamine release from the cultured mast cells.
Mast cells cultured from human progenitor cells in peripheral blood were sensitized with human myeloma IgE, and then challenged with anti-human IgE following pretreatment with diverse prostanoid receptor agonists. The histamine content in supernatants and cell pellets were measured by histamine auto-analyzer.
Of the prostanoid receptor agonists tested, the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor (EP receptor) agonist PGE2 (10(-7) to 10(-11) M) produced concentration-related potentiation of IgE-mediated histamine release from the cultured mast cells. Sulprostone, an EP1/EP3 agonist, SC-46275, a selective EP3 agonist, and 11-deoxy-PGE1, a selective EP2/EP3/EP4 agonist also caused a significant increase in histamine release induced by anti-IgE. BW245C, fluprostone, cicaprost and U46619 for the prostaglandin D2, F2alpha, I2, and thromboxane A2 receptors respectively, and the EP2/EP4 receptor agonist butaprost had little effect on anti-IgE stimulated histamine release from mast cells.",Does prostaglandin E potentiate the immunologically stimulated histamine release from human peripheral blood-derived mast cells through EP1/EP3 receptors?,Yes.

We can sometimes see small tumor clusters without desmoplasia and no evidence of lymphatic emboli around the main tumor mass of PTC. We termed this form of tumor clustering, 'tumor sprouting,' and determined whether these tumors correlate with lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, and recurrence.
We analyzed a total of 204 cases of papillary thyroid macrocarcinoma. Number, size and distance from the main tumor of the tumor sprouting were observed and analyzed with clinicopathologic characteristics.
Tumor sprouting was observed in 101 patients. Presence of tumor sprouting was significantly associated with positive resection margin (p=.002), lymphovascular invasion (p=.001), lymph node metastasis (p<.001), and recurrence (p=.004). Univariate analysis of recurrence-free survival revealed that tumor multiplicity (p=.037), positive resection margin (p=.007), lymphovascular invasion (p=.004), lymph node metastasis (p<.001), and tumor sprouting (p=.004) were poor prognostic factors. In multivariate analysis, positive resection margin was an independent poor prognostic factor of recurrence.",Is tumor sprouting in papillary thyroid carcinoma correlated with lymph node metastasis and recurrence?,"Yes. In conclusion, tumor sprouting is significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis and recurrence.

Two hundred and seven patients without any atherosclerotic disease history were included in this cross-sectional observational study. Correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness, which was measured by echocardiography and serum paraoxonase 1 level. Also correlation analysis was performed to show correlation between patients' clinical and laboratory findings and the level of serum paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) and the epicardial fat tissue thickness. Pearson and Spearman test were used for correlation analysis.
No linear correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness and serum PON 1 found (correlation coefficient: -0.127, p=0.069). When epicardial fat tissue thickness were grouped as 7 mm and over, and below, and 5 mm and over, and below, serum PON 1 level were significantly lower in ≥7 mm group (PON1 : 168.9 U/L) than<7 mm group (PON 1: 253.9 U/L) (p<0.001).

We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database from six centers in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Incident PD patients with a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score at the start of PD therapy and serum albumin level measured within 30 days of initiation were selected. Poisson regression was used to analyze predictors of peritonitis.
Three hundred ninety-three patients had a CCI score and serum albumin level measured at the start of PD therapy. Overall peritonitis rate was 0.65 episodes/dialysis-year. Significant univariate predictors were albumin level (rate ratio [RR], 0.79 per 1-g/dL [10-g/L] increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.95; P = 0.015), male sex (P = 0.003), and being dialyzed in the Veterans Administration (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.62; P < 0.001) or other center (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.92 to 5.62; P < 0.001). Although CCI score correlated inversely with albumin level (r = -0.305; P < 0.001), CCI score was only marginally predictive of peritonitis (P = 0.068). In multivariate analysis, predictors were albumin level (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.75; P = 0.002) and race (RR, 1.36; P = 0.024).

The finding that a single miRNA can regulate hundreds of genes places miRNAs at critical hubs of signaling pathways. For the current study, the authors investigated the miRNA expression profile of gastric adenocarcinomas and compared it with esophageal adenocarcinomas to better identify a unique miRNA signature of gastric adenocarcinoma.
miRNA expression profiles were obtained using 2 different proprietary microarray platforms on primary gastric adenocarcinoma tissue samples. The cross comparison of results identified 17 up-regulated miRNAs and 12 down-regulated miRNAs that overlapped in both platforms. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for independent validation of a representative set of 8 miRNAs in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas compared with normal gastric mucosa or esophageal mucosa, respectively.
The deregulation of miR-146b-5p, miR-375, miR-148a, miR-31, and miR-451 was associated significantly with gastric adenocarcinomas. Conversely, deregulation of miR-21 (up-regulation) and miR-133b (down-regulation) was detectable in both gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas. It was noteworthy that miR-200a was significantly down-regulated in gastric adenocarcinoma samples (P = .04) but was up-regulated in esophageal adenocarcinoma samples (P = .001). In addition, the expression level of miR-146b-5p displayed a strong correlation with the tumor stage of gastric cancer.",Does gastric adenocarcinoma have a unique microRNA signature not present in esophageal adenocarcinoma?,"Yes.

Twenty-three patients with organized glomerular Ig deposits were classified into two groups based on the fibrillar or microtubular ultrastructural appearance of the deposits. Kidney biopsy samples were studied by immunofluorescence microscopy, using anti-light chain conjugates (all cases) and anti-IgG subclass conjugates (13 patients). In each group, we studied clinicopathological features, associated monoclonal gammapathy (detected by immunoelectrophoresis and/or immunoblot) or B-cell lymphoproliferative disease, effects of chemotherapy and long-term renal outcome.
In 14 IT/MTGN and 9 FGN patients, clinical symptoms [hypertension, nephrotic syndrome (NS) and hematuria] and the mean diameters of the substructures were similar.

Neutrophil expression of CD11b was significantly higher in the femoral vein than the portal vein and systemic circulation during ischaemia [P=0.001 (FV vs. PV), P=0.017 (FV vs. systemic)] and reperfusion [P=0.001 (FV vs. PV), P=0.013 (FV vs. systemic)]. There were no significant differences in neutrophil CD11b expression between the systemic and portal vein samples at any time.",Does neutrophil activation occur in the lower-limbs of patients undergoing elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"Yes. Ischaemia and reperfusion during abdominal aortic aneurysm repair are associated with a global increase in the white cell count and neutrophil count, but with increased neutrophil CD11b expression only in the femoral vein. This suggests the lower-limbs are sensitive to aortic clamp-related reperfusion injury and may fuel the inflammatory response.",PASS,pubmedQA
1423,22179665,"MET, the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, is frequently overexpressed in colon cancers with high metastatic tendency. We aimed to evaluate the role of its negative regulators, miR-1 and miR-199a*, and its transcriptional activator, the metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1), in controlling MET expression in human colon cancer samples.
The expression of MET, miR-1, miR-199a*, and MACC1 was evaluated by real-time PCR in 52 matched pairs of colorectal cancers and nontumoral surrounding tissues. The biological role of miR-1 in controlling MET expression and biological activity was assessed in colon cancer cells either by its forced expression or by AntagomiR-mediated inhibition.
MiR-1 was downregulated in 84.6% of the tumors and its decrease significantly correlated with MET overexpression, particularly in metastatic tumors. We found that concurrent MACC1 upregulation and miR-1 downregulation are required to elicit the highest increase of MET expression. Consistent with a suppressive role of miR-1, its forced in vitro expression in colon cancer cells reduced MET levels and impaired MET-induced invasive growth. Finally, we identified a feedback loop between miR-1 and MET, resulting in their mutual regulation.",Does miR-1 downregulation cooperate with MACC1 in promoting MET overexpression in human colon cancer?,Yes. This study identifies an oncosuppressive role of miR-1 in colorectal cancer in which it acts by controlling MET expression through a feedback loop. Concomitant downregulation of miR-1 and increase of MACC1 can thus contribute to MET overexpression and to the metastatic behavior of colon cancer cells.,PASS,pubmedQA
1335,23929663,"Reactivity and titers of autoantibodies vary during the course of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and some autoantibodies have been associated with disease activity and adverse outcomes after treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the autoantibody behavior in AIH and its significance as predictors of biochemical and histological remission. A total of 117 patients with AIH (mean age 18.6 [4-69] years) were evaluated and tested for autoantibodies at disease onset and successively (mean 3.2 [2-6] times) after a mean follow-up evaluation of 70 [20-185] months. Antismooth muscle (ASMA), antiliver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1), antiliver cytosol type 1 (anti-LC1), antimitochondrial, antinuclear (ANA), and antiactin antibodies (AAA) were determined at disease onset and 379 other times during the follow-up evaluation through indirect immunofluorescence in rodent tissues, HEp-2 cells, and human fibroblasts. Anti-SLA/LP were assessed 45 times in the follow-up evaluation of 19 patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Upon admission, AIH types 1 and 2 were observed in 95 and 17 patients, respectively. Five subjects had AIH with anti-SLA/LP as the sole markers. Patients initially negative for AAA did not develop these antibodies thereafter. ANA were detected de novo in six and three subjects with AIH types 1 and 2, respectively. After treatment, only ASMA (>1:80) and AAA (>1:40) were significantly associated with biochemical (76.9% and 79.8%) and histological features (100% and 100%) of disease activity (P < 0.001).",Are antismooth muscle and antiactin antibodies indirect markers of histological and biochemical activity of autoimmune hepatitis?,"Yes. With the exception of ANA, the autoantibody profile does not markedly vary in the course of AIH. The persistence of high titers of ASMA and/or AAA in patients with AIH is associated with disease activity.",PASS,pubmedQA

In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs.
Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals.
Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12 months later.",SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in patients with essential tremor. Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?,"No. Our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, it appears that ET patients have a small degree of striatal dopaminergic degeneration. If this is due to alterations in the nigrostriatl pathway or of other origin it is not clear. Follow-up studies of essential tremor patients are warranted to assess progression of disease and to understand better the possible cause for striatal dopaminergic degeneration.",PASS,pubmedQA

In this investigation the effect of 8-OHDAPT, as a 5-HT(1A) agonist on anti-cataleptic effect of L-DOPA in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned male Wistar rats was investigated.
Catalepsy was induced by unilateral injection of 6-OHDA (8 µg/2µl/rat) into the central region of the SNc. After 3 weeks as a recovery period, animals received intraperitoneally (i.p.) L-DOPA (15 mg/kg) twice daily for 20 days, and anti-cataleptic effect of L-DOPA was assessed by bar-test at days of 5, 10, 15 and 20.",Does 5-HT ( 1A ) receptor activation improve anti-cataleptic effects of levodopa in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats?,"Yes. The results showed that L-DOPA had anti-cataleptic effect only until the day of 15, and its effect was decreased on the day of 20. On the day of 21, rats were co-injected with three different doses of 8-OHDAPT (0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and L-DOPA (15 mg/kg, ip). 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OHDAPT) improved anti-cataleptic effect of L-DOPA at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Moreover the effect of 8-OHDAPT on anti-cataleptic effect of L-DOPA (15 mg/kg, ip) was abolished by 1-(2-methyoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalamido) butyl] piperazine hydrobromide (NAN-190; 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) as a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. According to the obtained results, it may be concluded that activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors by 8-OHDAPT may improve anti-cataleptic effect of L-DOPA in a 6-OHDA- induced rat model of PD.

Fifty-five healthy pregnant women who underwent second-trimester genetic amniocentesis at a mean gestational age of 17.0 +/- 1.4 weeks composed study group A. Blood was drawn from each patient before amniocentesis, and an aliquot of amniotic fluid was obtained for this study. Twenty-one healthy patients at a mean gestational age of 35.5 +/- 4.8 weeks composed study group B, and blood was obtained from each patient at an outpatient prenatal visit. Twenty-two healthy, nonpregnant women of reproductive age composed the control group (C). All specimens were stored at -70 degrees C and collectively assayed for tumor necrosis factor-alpha by a specific enzyme-linked immunoassay.
All patients in group A had a normal karyotype and all patients in groups A and B had uneventful pregnancies. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha was detected in the plasma of 43 of 55 (78.2%) patients in group A compared with 7 of 21 (33.3%) patients in group B (p < 0.001); tumor necrosis factor-alpha was not detected in any of the 22 women in group C. The median plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha level for group A was 135 pg/ml (range 0 to 625 pg/ml) compared with 0 pg/ml (range 0 to 110 pg/ml) in group B (p < 0.001).

Although many stimulation protocols have been established to improve clinical outcomes in poor ovarian responders (PORs), which protocol is the most effective remains controversial. Luteal-phase ovarian stimulation (LPOS) has been used in normal ovarian responders with satisfactory outcomes. However, the efficacy of LPOS in PORs is unclear. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of LPOS and GnRH antagonist (GnRH-ant) in PORs.
The clinical parameters in PORs who received LPOS (50 cycles in 39 patients) or GnRH-ant (158 cycles in 123 patients) were compared.
Compared with those in the GnRH-ant group, the PORs in the LPOS group showed significantly fewer basal antral follicles (3.1 ± 2.2 vs. 4.1 ± 1.6, p < 0.001) and a higher in vitro fertilization rate. There were no significant differences in the numbers of retrieved oocytes and D3 transferable embryos between the two groups. However, the pregnancy rate in the LPOS group (46.4%) was significantly higher than that in the GnRH-ant group (25.8% overall; 22.9% from fresh embryos and 29.6% from frozen embryos). Moreover, 23 PORs in the LPOS group underwent oocyte retrieval twice in one cycle, and the numbers of retrieved oocytes and transferable embryos from the luteal phase were significantly higher than those from the follicular phase in the same menstrual cycle.",Is luteal-phase ovarian stimulation a feasible method for poor ovarian responders undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer treatment compared to a GnRH antagonist protocol : A retrospective study?,"Yes.

1237,23731651,"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent arterial and venous vasodilator. Increased airway epithelial cell expression of CGRP, together with increased CCL17 expression, was previously observed in a model of provoked asthma in atopic human subjects.
We sought to determine whether CCL17 induces CCR4-dependent CGRP synthesis and secretion by human airway epithelial cells.
Human airway epithelial cell lines (BEAS-2B and A549) and human primary airway cells were cultured with CCL17 or various other cytokines, and CGRP expression was measured by using RT-PCR, quantitative immunofluorescence, and enzyme immunoassay. CCR4 expression was determined in cultured cells by using flow cytometry and in bronchial biopsy specimens by using immunohistochemistry.
CCL17 induced a several thousand-fold increase in CGRP mRNA expression and released peptide product from BEAS-2B and A549 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Concentration-dependent CCL17-induced release of CGRP by primary human airway epithelial cells was also observed. Under comparable conditions, CCL17 induced greater CGRP release from BEAS-2B cells than either IL-13, a cytokine mixture (TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IL-1), or CCL22. CCR4 was expressed by BEAS-2B and A549 cells and internalized after ligation with CCL17. CCL17-induced CGRP release was inhibited by a specific anti-CCR4 blocking antibody. Bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients before and after provoked asthma all exhibited CCR4 staining of equivalent intensity, indicating that the receptor is constitutively expressed.",Does cCL17/thymus and activation-regulated chemokine induce calcitonin gene-related peptide in human airway epithelial cells through CCR4?,"Yes.

1117,26852107,"The critical issue related to breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is that cosmetic outcomes deteriorate with long-term follow-up. There is little research for breast density as a predictor of cosmetic outcomes at the late stage after BCT. To improve the long-term quality of life after BCT of breast cancer patients, the correlation of volumetric breast density (VBD) and cosmetic outcome at the late stage after BCT was evaluated.
Breast volume, fibroglandular tissue volume, adipose tissue volume, and VBD were calculated on mammography using image analysis software (Volpara(®)) in 151 patients with BCT. Furthermore, the correlation of breast density and the change of breast volume over time was analyzed on mammography in 99 patients who were followed-up long-term after BCT.
On multivariate analysis, VBD was a predictor of cosmetic outcome after BCT with percent breast volume excised (PBVE). Decreased adipose tissue volume and increased fibrosis were more common in patients with VBD < 15%. Furthermore, remnant breast volume continued to decrease over time in low breast density patients during long-term follow-up. 93% of patients with VBD ≥ 15% and PBVE < 10% had a better cosmetic outcome, while 60% of patients with VBD < 15% and PBVE ≥ 10% had a worse cosmetic outcome after BCT.",Is volumetric breast density essential for predicting cosmetic outcome at the late stage after breast-conserving surgery?,"Yes.

The following parameters were assessed: rCBF, DC potential, and tissue impedance. 5 or 15 min after onset of flow reduction one SD wave was initiated by microinjection of KCl. Histology was performed after 7 days.
In animals with hypotension there was depolarization resembling anoxic depolarization after SD induction and an uncoupling of CBF and metabolism only in the right hemisphere.

1176,12407146,"To examine the mechanism underlying transcript heterogeneity in the gene for the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR).
Transcript heterogeneity was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR), rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and transient expression of minigene constructs. Protein variants were identified by immunoblot analysis and by immunocytochemistry.
RPGR transcripts terminated either uniformly at the end of exon 19, producing the constitutive transcript with few variants, or at variable sites downstream from exon 15. The latter transcripts resembled the previously described open reading frame (ORF)14/15 variant, but the ORF14/15 exon was not found in full length. Instead, various portions of a purine-rich region were removed as introns. Numerous splice site combinations were used, giving rise to innumerable variants. Analysis of the purine-rich region found multiple exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) known to promote splicing through interaction with serine-arginine repeat (SR) proteins. Antibodies targeting different regions of RPGR detected a multitude of RPGR proteins in photoreceptors, concentrated in the connecting cilium. Predominant ORF14/15-encoded RPGR polypeptides migrated at approximately 200 kDa and were photoreceptor specific.",Does complex expression pattern of RPGR reveal a role for purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers?,Yes. The exceptional heterogeneity in RPGR transcript processing results primarily from a novel form of alternative RNA splicing mediated by multiple exonic splicing enhancers.

Impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and an increased frequency in deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes some of the subunits of the ETC, have been reported in the substantia nigra of PD brains. The identification of mutations in the PINK1 gene, which cause an autosomal recessive form of PD, has supported mitochondrial involvement in PD. The PINK1 protein is a serine/threonine kinase localized in mitochondria and the cytosol. Its precise function is unknown, but it is involved in neuroprotection against a variety of stress signalling pathways.
In this report we have investigated the effect of silencing PINK1 expression in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells by siRNA on mtDNA synthesis and ETC function. Loss of PINK1 expression resulted in a decrease in mtDNA levels and mtDNA synthesis. We also report a concomitant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased mitochondrial ATP synthesis, with the activity of complex IV of the ETC most affected.

Our aim was to evaluate the ability of the Work Instability Scale for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA-WIS) to predict arthritis-related work transitions within a 12-month period.
Workers with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 250) from 3 clinical sites participated in self-administered surveys that assessed the impact of health on employment at multiple time points over 12 months. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to assess the ability of the RA-WIS (range 0-23, where 23 = highest work instability) to predict 4 types of work transition: reductions in work hours, disability leaves of absence, changes in job/occupation, or temporary unemployment, assembled as a composite outcome. Covariates assessed include age, sex, education, marital status, income, pain intensity, disease duration, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCCs) were also assessed to further examine the predictive ability of the RA-WIS and to determine optimal cut points for predicting specific work transitions.
After 12 months, 21.7% (n = 50 of 230) of the participants had indicated at least one arthritis-related work transition. Higher baseline RA-WIS was predictive of such an outcome (relative risk [RR] 1.05 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.00-1.11]), particularly at >17 (RR 2.30 [95% CI 1.11-4.77]).

Some studies show that HFCS consumption correlates with obesity and insulin resistance, while other studies are in disagreement. Owing to conflicting and insufficient scientific evidence, the safety of HFCS consumption remains controversial.
We investigated the metabolic consequences of mice fed a (a) regular diet, (b) 'Western' high-fat diet or (c) regular diet supplemented with 8% HFCS in drinking water (to mimic soft drinks) for 10 months. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) have emerged as a major pathogenic factor for obesity and insulin resistance. ATMs consist of proinflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(+) macrophages and anti-inflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(-) macrophages. In this study, we assessed the effects of HFCS on ATMs in intra-abdominal fat.
We found that HFCS feeding in mice induced more severe adipose inflammation and insulin resistance than even the higher-calorie-containing 'Western' high-fat diet, and these HFCS-induced deleterious effects were independent of calorie intake or body fat content. We showed that similar to 'Western' high-fat diet, HFCS triggered a robust increase of both proinflammatory ATMs and anti-inflammatory ATMs in intra-abdominal fat. Remarkably, however, the anti-inflammatory ATMs were much less abundant in HFCS-fed mice than in high-fat-fed mice. Furthermore, we showed that deletion of the ghrelin receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor, GHS-R) ameliorates HFCS-induced adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. HFCS-fed GHS-R-null mice exhibit decreased proinflammatory ATMs in intra-abdominal fat, reduced adipose inflammation and attenuated liver steatosis.",Does ghrelin receptor regulate HFCS-induced adipose inflammation and insulin resistance?,"No. Our studies demonstrate that HFCS has detrimental effects on metabolism, suggesting that dietary guidelines on HFCS consumption for Americans may need to be revisited.

In general, gene expression suggested that senior dogs had an increased risk of the progression of liver disease and dysfunction, as observed in aged humans and rodents. In particular for aged liver, genes related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and glycolysis were up-regulated, whereas genes related to regeneration, xenobiotic metabolism, and cholesterol trafficking were down-regulated. Diet-associated changes in gene expression were more common in young adult dogs (33 genes) as compared to senior dogs (3 genes).",Do age and diet affect gene expression profiles in canine liver tissue?,"Yes. Our results provide molecular insight pertaining to the aged canine liver and its predisposition to disease and abnormalities. Therefore, our data may aid in future research pertaining to age-associated alterations in hepatic function or identification of potential targets for nutritional management as a means to decrease incidence of age-dependent liver dysfunction. Interestingly, diet-associated changes in gene expression were more common in senior dogs compared to young adult dogs.",FAIL,pubmedQA
1604,25623806,"Our goal was to identify brain structures responsible for pain-related autonomic changes by the correlation of simultaneously acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Eighteen healthy men (age: 22.89 ± 1.96) were involved. Painful sensation was evoked by heat. Simultaneously recorded brain fMRI and ECG data during pain were compared to data acquired during a non-painful heat sensation. From the ECG data, time- and frequency domain parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) were extracted.
We found that: (1) among the common elements of both pain network and central autonomic network (CAN) only the medial prefrontal frontal cortex (MPFC) showed significant correlation with HRV; (2) the parasympathetic response to the painful stimuli showed a positive, while the sympathetic response a negative association with pain related BOLD-signal change observed in MPFC; (3) time domain parameters of HRV were negatively associated with MPFC activation.",Is pain-related autonomic response modulated by the medial prefrontal cortex : An ECG-fMRI study in men?,"No. The novelty of our study-compared to previous ECG-fMRI studies-is that we used pain as stimulus and investigated both frequency- and time-domain parameters of HRV.

1894,10379739,"The limitation of current urinary tumor markers is the low specificity and positive predictive value, which clinically manifests as a high false-positive rate. We analyzed the false-positive data of 2 urinary tumor markers, NMP22 and the BTA stat tests. We examined the clinical categories of the false-positive results, established relative exclusion criteria, and recalculated the specificity and positive predictive value after using the exclusion criteria.
A total of 278 symptomatic patients who presented to a urology clinic were asked to submit a single voided urine sample. Each sample was divided into 3 aliquots of which 1 was stabilized with the NMP22 test kit stabilizer and assayed for NMP22, 1 was tested for BTA stat and 1 was sent for cytological examination. All patients subsequently underwent office cystoscopy and bladder biopsy if indicated.
Of the 278 symptomatic patients 112 presented with microscopic hematuria, 77 gross hematuria and 89 chronic symptoms of urinary frequency or dysuria. Of 34 cases (12%) of histologically confirmed bladder cancer NMP22 detected 28 (82.4%), BTA stat 23 (67.7%) and cytology only 10 (29.4%). When atypical cytologies were considered positive, cytology then detected 19 cases (55.9%). Elevated NMP22 values were positive in 28 cases and false-positive in 44 for a specificity of 82% and a positive predictive value of 38.9%. Similarly, BTA stat test was positive in 23 cases and false-positive in 43 for a specificity of 82.4% and a positive predictive value of 34.9%. When atypical cytologies were considered positive, the specificity and positive predictive value were 93% and 55.9%. Greater than 80% of the false-positive results were clinically categorized as benign inflammatory or infectious conditions, renal or bladder calculi, recent history of a foreign body in the urinary tract, bowel interposition segment, another genitourinary cancer or an instrumented urinary sample.

1877,23046676,"Acetaminophen (AAP) overdose is the most frequent cause of drug-induced liver failure. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is thought to play a central role in AAP-induced hepatocellular necrosis. The apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is a death repressor that inhibits death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. Here, we investigated ARC's therapeutic effect and molecular mechanisms on AAP-induced hepatocellular necrosis.
We tested the in vivo and in vitro effects of ARC fused with the transduction domain of HIV-1 (TAT-ARC) on murine AAP hepatotoxicity.
Treatment with TAT-ARC protein completely abrogated otherwise lethal liver failure induced by AAP overdose in C57BL/6 mice. AAP triggered caspase-independent necrosis, as evidenced by liver histology, elevated serum transaminases, and secreted HMGB1 that was inhibited by ARC. ARC-mediated hepatoprotection was not caused by an alteration of AAP metabolism, but resulted in reduced oxidative stress. AAP overdose led to induction of RIP-dependent signaling with subsequent JNK activation. Ectopic ARC inhibited JNK activation by specific interactions between ARC and JNK1 and JNK2. Importantly, survival of mice was even preserved when ARC therapy was initiated in a delayed manner after AAP administration.",Is aRC a novel therapeutic approach against acetaminophen-induced hepatocellular necrosis?,Yes. This work identifies for the first time ARC-JNK-binding with subsequent inhibition of JNK signaling as a specific mechanism of ARC to interfere with AAP-dependent necrosis.

To quantitate the number of symptomatic instrumentation failures (SIFs) encountered during a 2-year period. The effect of sagittal plane imbalance (corrected or uncorrected) on the rate of SIF was evaluated.
Retrospective evaluation of all patients requiring spinal instrumentation to determine which factors predispose toward instrumentation failure.
All patients requiring spinal instrumentation over a 2-year period were retrospectively studied.
Sagittal plane imbalance pre- and postoperatively was determined using Cobb angle analysis on plain X-rays. SIF was defined as screw back-out and/or breakage, pseudarthrosis, cage migration, or rod disconnection in patients with concordant symptoms. Asymptomatic patients did not demonstrate instrumentation failure on the routine postoperative X-rays.
Of the 355 patients who fit the criteria, 47 patients presented with either idiopathic or secondary sagittal plane deformity preoperatively. Additionally, long-segment fixation, smoking, age, and fixation across junctional segments were evaluated as risk factors for SIF.
Of the 47 patients with sagittal plane deformity, 40 patients (85%) achieved correction demonstrated on postoperative radiographs whereas in 7 (15%), the sagittal plane imbalance was not corrected. Of these seven cases, five suffered instrumentation failure (failure rate 71.5%) versus no instrumentation failures (failure rate 0%) for the remaining 40 patients.

Retrospective case-control study.
We enrolled 190 unrelated Taiwan Chinese patients with late AMD and 90 age- and gender-matched control subjects. Grading of late AMD was classified based on a standardized set of diagnostic criteria established by the International Age-Related Maculopathy Epidemiologic Study. Late AMD was classified as either atrophic (dry, grade 4) or neovascular (wet, grade 5). Atrophic AMD refers to dry late-stage AMD without neovascularization, and wet AMD refers to neovascular AMD. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was prepared from peripheral blood obtained from all AMD patients and control subjects. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to analyze this polymorphism.
Of the 190 participants with late AMD, atrophic AMD was diagnosed in 104 patients and wet AMD was diagnosed in 86 patients. The genotype distribution of the Met72Thr (T/C) variant of PEDF was TT (homozygous T), TC (heterozygous), and CC (homozygous C). The T allele was found significantly more frequently in wet AMD patients than in controls (50% vs 31%; P =.0005). The allele frequencies in atrophic AMD (30%) and controls (31%) did not differ significantly (all P = .87).

Effects of nicotine on Kv4.3 and Kv4.2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes were studied at the whole-cell and single-channel levels. The effects of nicotine on the transient outward K(+) current (I:(to)) were studied by use of whole-cell patch-clamp techniques in canine ventricular myocytes. Nicotine potently inhibited Kv4 current. The concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC(50)) was 40+/-4 nmol/L, and the current was abolished by 100 micromol/L nicotine. The IC(50) for block of native I:(to) was 270+/-43 nmol/L. The steady-state activation properties of Kv4.3 and I:(to) were unaltered by nicotine, whereas positive shifts of the inactivation curves were observed. Of the total inhibition of Kv4.3 and I:(to) by nicotine, 40% was due to tonic block and 60% was attributable to use-dependent block. Activation, inactivation, and reactivation kinetics were not significantly changed by nicotine. Nicotine reduced single-channel conductance, open probability, and open time but increased the closed time of Kv4.3.

1961,22436404,"Prions, composed of a misfolded protein designated PrP(Sc), are infectious agents causing fatal neurodegenerative diseases. We have shown previously that, following induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, prion-infected mice succumb to disease significantly earlier than controls, concomitant with the deposition of PrP(Sc) aggregates in inflamed white matter areas. In the present work, we asked whether prion disease acceleration by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis results from infiltration of viable prion-infected immune cells into the central nervous system.
C57Bl/6 J mice underwent intraperitoneal inoculation with scrapie brain homogenates and were later induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by inoculation of MOG(35-55) in complete Freund's adjuvant supplemented with pertussis toxin. Spleen and lymph node cells from the co-induced animals were reactivated and subsequently injected into naïve mice as viable cells or as cell homogenates. Control groups were infected with viable and homogenized scrapie immune cells only with complete Freund's adjuvant. Prion disease incubation times as well as levels and sites of PrP(Sc) deposition were next evaluated.
We first show that acceleration of prion disease by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis requires the presence of high levels of spleen PrP(Sc). Next, we present evidence that mice infected with activated prion-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis viable cells succumb to prion disease considerably faster than do mice infected with equivalent cell extracts or other controls, concomitant with the deposition of PrP(Sc) aggregates in white matter areas in brains and spinal cords.",Does targeting of prion-infected lymphoid cells to the central nervous system accelerate prion infection?,No. Our results indicate that inflammatory targeting of viable prion-infected immune cells to the central nervous system does not accelerate prion disease propagation.

1836,19344532,"Plastids arose from a free-living cyanobacterial endosymbiont and multiply by binary division as do cyanobacteria. Plastid division involves nucleus-encoded homologs of cyanobacterial division proteins such as FtsZ, MinD, MinE, and ARC6. However, homologs of many other cyanobacterial division genes are missing in plant genomes and proteins of host eukaryotic origin, such as a dynamin-related protein, PDV1 and PDV2 are involved in the division process. Recent identification of plastid division proteins has started to elucidate the similarities and differences between plastid division and cyanobacterial cell division. To further identify new proteins that are required for plastid division, we characterized previously and newly isolated plastid division mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana.
Leaf cells of two mutants, br04 and arc2, contain fewer, larger chloroplasts than those of wild type. We found that ARC2 and BR04 are identical to nuclear genes encoding the plastid chaperonin 60 alpha (ptCpn60alpha) and chaperonin 60 beta (ptCpn60beta) proteins, respectively. In both mutants, plastid division FtsZ ring formation was partially perturbed though the level of FtsZ2-1 protein in plastids of ptcpn60beta mutants was similar to that in wild type. Phylogenetic analyses showed that both ptCpn60 proteins are derived from ancestral cyanobacterial proteins. The A. thaliana genome encodes two members of ptCpn60alpha family and four members of ptCpn60beta family respectively. We found that a null mutation in ptCpn60alpha abolished greening of plastids and resulted in an albino phenotype while a weaker mutation impairs plastid division and reduced chlorophyll levels. The functions of at least two ptCpn60beta proteins are redundant and the appearance of chloroplast division defects is dependent on the number of mutant alleles.",Are plastid chaperonin proteins Cpn60 alpha and Cpn60 beta required for plastid division in Arabidopsis thaliana?,"No. Our results suggest that neither ptCpn60alpha nor ptCpn60beta are required for the formation of a normal plastid division apparatus, as the prokaryotic counterparts are not required for assembly of the cell division apparatus. Since moderate reduction of ptCpn60 levels did not impair normal FtsZ ring formation but did affect import of FtsZ into plastids, it is suggested that the proper levels of ptCpn60 are not required for folding of stromal plastid division proteins and/or regulation of FtsZ polymer dynamics.",FAIL,pubmedQA

Data were prospectively collected on 924 consecutive colonoscopies performed over a 31-month period. Comparisons were made between two groups: patients 80 years of age or older (Group O) and patients less than 80 years of age (Group Y). Data were collected on sedation, crude and adjusted total colonoscopy rates, ileoscopy rate, anus to cecum time, total procedure time, diagnostic yield, and complications. Appropriate exclusions were made to calculate procedure success rates and time.
Patients in Group O (n=110) received significantly less sedative medication compared with Group Y (n=814) (median dosage for midazolam, 1 mg vs. 2.5 mg; median dosage for meperidine, 12.5 vs. 25 mg; p < 0.0001).

To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion.
In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR.
In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113±41 ml min""1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). Baseline cTn (0.08±0.02 ng ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 45 min of reperfusion (+138%, p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 (9.2±2.17 pg ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 60 min of reperfusion (+228%, p<0.0001). Significant LVP drop at 5 min of ischemia (p<0.05) was followed by a slow return to baseline at 45 min of ischemia. A second LVP drop occurred at reperfusion (p<0.05) and persisted. Conversely, RVP increased throughout ischemia (p<0.05) and returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Coronary blood flow and hemodynamic profile remained unchanged in the control group.

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.
We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.
The prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity.",Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders?,"No. Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults.

Abridged lifetables for the period 1999-2003 were constructed using standard demographic methods for each of four ethnic groups (Asian, Pacific, Maori and European) by NZDep2001 quintile and sex. Gradients were estimated by fitting generalised linear models to the quintile-specific life expectancy estimates for each ethnic group (by sex). The contribution of variation in deprivation distributions to inter-ethnic inequalities in life expectancy was estimated by re-weighting the quintile-specific mortality rates for each ethnic group using weights derived from the European deprivation distribution and recalculating the lifetable.

By contouring the shape of these vascular lesions (""virtual endarterectomy""), advanced morphometric analysis can be performed. The objective of our study is to determine whether quantitative shape analysis can accurately differentiate FFT from atherosclerotic plaque.
We collected 23 consecutive cases of suspected carotid FFT seen on CTA (13 men, 65 ± 10 years; 10 women, 65.5 ± 8.8 years). True-positive FFT cases (FFT+) were defined as filling defects resolving with anticoagulant therapy versus false-positives (FFT-), which remained unchanged. Lesion volumes were extracted from CTA images and quantitative shape descriptors were computed. The five most discriminative features were used to construct receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and to generate three machine-learning classifiers. Average classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation.
Follow-up imaging confirmed sixteen FFT+ and seven FFT- cases. Five shape descriptors delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases. The logistic regression model produced from combining all five shape features demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 71.4% with an area under the ROC curve = 0.85 ± 0.09.

Since dysregulation of IL-1 signalling is considered a pathogenic mechanism in a number of related autoinflammatory conditions, we examined the extent to which unimpeded interleukin (IL)-1 signalling influences NOD2-dependent inflammation of the eye versus the joint.
Mice deficient for IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) were administered the NOD2 agonist muramyl dipeptide (MDP) by systemic (intraperitoneal) or local (intraocular and/or intra-articular) injections. NOD2-deficient mice received an intraocular injection of recombinant IL-1β. Uveitis was evaluated by intravital videomicroscopy and histopathology, and arthritis was assessed by near-infrared imaging and histopathology. Ocular levels of IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-1Ra were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
IL-1Ra deficiency did not render mice more responsive to systemic exposure of MDP. Despite the increased production of IL-1R agonists IL-1α and IL-1β in response to intraocular injection of MDP, deficiency in IL-1Ra did not predispose mice to MDP-triggered uveitis, albeit intravascular cell rolling and adherence were exacerbated.

1983,26013149,"Synovial quantification of C-reactive protein (SCRP) has been recently published with high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. However, to our knowledge, no studies have compared the use of this test with intraoperative frozen section, which is considered by many to be the best intraoperative test now available.
We asked whether intraoperative SCRP could lead to comparable sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values as intraoperative frozen section in revision total hip arthroplasty.
A prospective study was performed including 76 patients who underwent hip revision for any cause. SCRP quantification (using 9.5 mg/L as denoting infection) and the analysis of frozen section of intraoperative samples (five or more polymorphonuclear leukocytes under high magnification in 10 fields) were performed in all the patients. The definitive diagnosis of an infection was determined according to the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS). In this group, 30% of the patients were diagnosed with infection using the MSIS criteria (23 of 76 patients).
With the numbers available, there were no differences between SCRP and frozen section in terms of their ability to diagnose infection. The sensitivity of SCRP was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.8%-98.6%), the specificity was 94% (95% CI, 84.5%-98.7%), the positive predictive value was 87% (95% CI, 66.3%-97%), and the negative predictive value was 96% (95% CI, 87%-99.4%); the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were the same using frozen sections to diagnose infection. The positive likelihood ratio was 16.36 (95% CI, 5.4-49.5), indicating a low probability of an individual without the condition having a positive test, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03-0.36), indicating low probability of an individual without the condition having a negative test.",Is intraoperative synovial C-reactive protein as useful as frozen section to detect periprosthetic hip infection?,"Yes. We found that quantitative SCRP had similar diagnostic value as intraoperative frozen section with comparable sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value in a group of patients undergoing revision total hip arthroplasty.

For all tested CT scanners, when the classification of the various types of stones was arranged according to the mean CT-attenuation values and to the confidence interval, large overlappings between stone types were highlighted. The t-paired test showed that most stone types could not be identified. Some types of stones presented mean CT attenuation values significantly different from one CT scanner to another. At 80kV, the mean CT attenuation values obtained with the Toshiba Aquilion were significantly different from those obtained with the Siemens Sensation. On the other hand, mean values obtained with the Philips Brilliance were all significantly equal to those obtained with the Siemens Sensation and with the Toshiba Aquilion.

The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity.
100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated.
Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia.

1546,21645374,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.
The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.",Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?,"Yes. Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a linear structure along the cell walls during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.",FAIL,pubmedQA

Beside well-known mechanisms of increased right heart load in COPD, dedicated changes of the left ventricle (LV) are ill-defined and the question remains, whether specific interactions exist beyond common shared risk factors.
LV wall stress was calculated based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in 28 patients with COPD (GOLD I to III) and coexistent heart failure (LVEF 42 ± 19%) due to non-ischaemic and ischaemic cardiomyopathy.
LV enddiastolic (p = 0.048) and endsystolic wall stress (p = 0.034) increased from GOLD stage I to III. Reduced FEV1 was correlated with increased enddiastolic (p = 0.0210) and endsystolic LV volume (p = 0.0413) and with increased enddiastolic (p = 0.0161) and endsystolic LV wall stress (p = 0.0315), respectively. Increased wall stress was associated with a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio.",Is airflow limitation in COPD associated with increased left ventricular wall stress in coincident heart failure?,"No. The severity of airflow limitation in COPD was not correlated with increased LV wall stress. It is suggested that respiration in pulmonary obstruction is not associated with an increased negative intrathoracic pressure when compared with normal lung function, which is transmitted to the heart and does not increase the transmural pressure gradient and thereby distending forces on the heart. Increased ventricular wall stress is not known to be associated with a broad variety of unfavourable consequences, which should be taken into account to contribute to a worse prognosis in COPD.",FAIL,pubmedQA

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and biological characteristics of 51 hypertetraploid breast carcinomas selected from a series of 860 consecutive cases analysed by flow cytometry.
The clinicopathological characteristics of the hypertetraploid group were compared with those of a control group of 138 non-hypertetraploid breast carcinomas. Breast tumours from patients submitted to surgery as primary therapeutic approach (15 hypertetraploid and the 138 non-hypertetraploid) were TNM staged and classified according to the histological type and grade. The remaining 36 patients had advanced neoplastic disease at presentation and were classified by cytological criteria only. DNA flow cytometric analysis was performed on fresh-frozen samples stained with propidium iodide. Hormone receptors were analysed by immunocytochemistry.
The incidence of hypertetraploid breast tumours was 5.9% (51 of 860). All the patients were women and the mean age at diagnosis was 65 years. There was a family history of breast cancer in 21.6% of cases. In the group of operated patients, 33.3% had pT3 tumours and 53.3% had axillary lymph node metastases.

Increased posterior-inferior directed slope of the medial and lateral tibial plateaus are associated with increased risk of suffering a noncontact ACL injury.
Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
In sum, 176 athletes competing in organized sports at the college and high school levels participated in the study: 88 suffering their first noncontact ACL injury and 88 matched controls. Magnetic resonance images were acquired, and geometry of the subchondral bone portion of the tibial plateau was characterized on each athlete bilaterally by measuring the medial and lateral tibial plateau slopes, coronal tibial slope, and the depth of the medial tibial plateau. Comparisons between knees of the same person were made with paired t tests, and associations with injury risk were assessed by conditional logistic regression analysis of ACL-injured and control participants.
Controls exhibited side-to-side symmetry of subchondral bone geometry, while the ACL-injured athletes did not, suggesting that the ACL injury may have changed the subchondral bone geometry. Therefore, the uninjured knees of the ACL-injured athletes and the corresponding limbs of their matched controls were used to assess associations with injury risk.

Immunoblotting, qRT-PCR, and gene expression arrays were carried out to identify genes modulated by SGI-1776 treatment. The anticancer activity of SGI-1776 and sunitinib was determined by viability and apoptosis assays and in tumour xenografts in vivo.
Treatment with SGI-1776 led to a decrease in phosphorylated and total c-Myc levels, which resulted in the modulation of c-Myc target genes. SGI-1776 in combination with sunitinib induced a further reduction in c-Myc levels, which was associated with enhanced anticancer activity. siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc demonstrated that its expression has a key role in regulating the sensitivity to the combination of SGI-1776 and sunitinib.

Compared to non-Hispanic whites, racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to be vaccinated for influenza, despite being at increased risk for influenza-related complications and death. Also, vaccinated minorities are more likely to receive influenza vaccinations in office-based settings and less likely to use non-medical vaccination locations compared to non-Hispanic white vaccine users.
To assess the number of ""missed opportunities"" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings by race and ethnicity and the magnitude of potential vaccine uptake and reductions in racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination if these ""missed opportunities"" were eliminated.
National cross-sectional Internet survey administered between March 4 and March 14, 2010 in the United States.

We collected data on influenza vaccination, frequency and timing of healthcare visits, and self-reported compliance with a potential provider recommendation for vaccination during the 2009-2010 influenza season. ""Missed opportunities"" for seasonal influenza vaccination in office-based settings were defined as the number of unvaccinated respondents who reported at least one healthcare visit in the Fall and Winter of 2009-2010 and indicated their willingness to get vaccinated if a healthcare provider strongly recommended it. ""Potential vaccine uptake"" was defined as the sum of actual vaccine uptake and ""missed opportunities.""

To identify if step width, iliotibial band strain and strain rate, positive and negative free moment, pelvic drop, hip adduction, knee internal rotation, and rearfoot eversion differ between habitual rearfoot and habitual mid-/forefoot strikers when running with both a rearfoot strike (RFS) and a mid-/forefoot strike (FFS) at 3 stride lengths.
Controlled laboratory study.
A total of 42 healthy runners (21 habitual rearfoot, 21 habitual mid-/forefoot) ran overground at 3.35 m/s with both a RFS and a FFS at their preferred stride lengths and 5% and 10% shorter.
Variables did not differ between habitual groups. Step width was 1.5 cm narrower for FFS, widening to 0.8 cm as stride length shortened. Iliotibial band strain and strain rate did not differ between foot strikes but decreased as stride length shortened (0.3% and 1.8%/s, respectively). Pelvic drop was reduced 0.7° for FFS compared with RFS, and both pelvic drop and hip adduction decreased as stride length shortened (0.8° and 1.5°, respectively). Peak knee internal rotation was not affected by foot strike or stride length. Peak rearfoot eversion was not different between foot strikes but decreased 0.6° as stride length shortened. Peak positive free moment (normalized to body weight [BW] and height [h]) was not affected by foot strike or stride length.

We investigated the effect of androgens and leptin on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) expression and secretion in human GnRH-secreting neuroblasts (FNC-B4).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR for mRNA expression and radioimmunoassay for GnRH secretion were used. Immunohistochemical studies assessed GnRH protein expression. FNC-B4 migration was analyzed with multiwell Boyden chamber technique.
Effects of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and leptin in FNC-B4 were tested after 24 and 48 hours.
Exposure to increasing concentrations of DHT after 24 hours significantly stimulated GnRH mRNA in FNC-B4. This effect was still present after prolonged exposure (48 hours). Similarly, treatment with leptin significantly induced GnRH mRNA after 24 hours, but not at 48 hours. Interestingly, mRNA for leptin receptors (LEPR) was significantly reduced after 48 hours of leptin, while, at this time point, it was stimulated by DHT. Coincubation for 48 hours with leptin and DHT maintained the stimulatory effect on both GnRH and LEPR mRNA, suggesting that DHT could stabilize the leptin effect by preventing downregulation of LEPR. Similar results were obtained for GnRH protein expression analysis. Moreover, both DHT and leptin increased GnRH release into the culture medium. We also found that DHT or leptin treatment significantly increased FNC-B4 basal migration. As we previously found that GnRH stimulates FNC-B4 migration, we hypothesized that this effect could be mediated by DHT- and leptin-induced GnRH release. Accordingly, the GnRH antagonist cetrorelix inhibited DHT- and leptin-induced migration.",Do dihydrotestosterone and leptin regulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) expression and secretion in human GnRH-secreting neuroblasts?,"Yes.

A total number of 1397 patients were included in this research. The metastasis rate of station 9 was 3.45%, which was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations. This metastasis rate was significantly correlated with pT stage, the lobe where the tumor was located, metastasis status of intrapulmonary lymph nodes, pTNM stage, and most of the other mediastinal lymph node stations. In males or ground glass opacity (GGO) patients, the metastasis of station 9 nodes was more unlikely to occur, even though there was no statistical significance.

1914,21952690,"Higher long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) in infant compared with maternal lipids at delivery is named biomagnification. The decline of infant and maternal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status during lactation in Western countries suggests maternal depletion. We investigated whether biomagnification persists at lifelong high fish intakes and whether the latter prevents a postpartum decline of infant and/or maternal DHA status.
We studied 3 Tanzanian tribes with low (Maasai: 0/week), intermediate (Pare: 2-3/week), and high (Sengerema: 4-5/week) fish intakes. DHA and arachidonic acid (AA) were determined in maternal (m) and infant (i) erythrocytes (RBC) during pregnancy (1st trimester n = 14, 2nd = 103, 3rd = 88), and in mother-infant pairs at delivery (n = 63) and at 3 months postpartum (n = 104).
At delivery, infants of all tribes had similar iRBC-AA which was higher than, and unrelated to, mRBC-AA. Transplacental DHA biomagnification occurred up to 5.6 g% mRBC-DHA; higher mRBC-DHA was associated with ""bioattenuation"" (i.e., iRBC-DHA < mRBC-DHA). Compared to delivery, mRBC-AA after 3 months was higher, while iRBC-AA was lower. mRBC-DHA after 3 months was lower, while iRBC-DHA was lower (low fish intake), equal (intermediate fish intake), and higher (high fish intake) compared to delivery. We estimated that postpartum iRBC-DHA equilibrium is reached at 5.9 g%, which corresponds to a mRBC-DHA of 6.1 g% throughout pregnancy.",Is a maternal erythrocyte DHA content of approximately 6 g % the DHA status at which intrauterine DHA biomagnifications turns into bioattenuation and postnatal infant DHA equilibrium is reached?,"Yes. Uniform high iRBC-AA at delivery might indicate the importance of intrauterine infant AA status.

Structural changes in VMH circuit morphology have the potential to alter VMH function throughout life, however, molecular signals responsible for specifying its neural connections are not fully defined. The VMH contains a high density of neurons that express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a potent neurodevelopmental effector known to regulate neuronal survival, growth, differentiation, and connectivity in a number of neural systems. In the current study, we examined whether BDNF impacts the afferent and efferent connections of the VMH, as well as energy homeostatic function.
To determine if BDNF is required for VMH circuit formation, a transgenic mouse model was used to conditionally delete Bdnf from steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) expressing neurons of the VMH prior to the onset of establishing neural connections with other regions. Projections of SF1 expressing neurons were visualized with a genetically targeted fluorescent label and immunofluorescence was used to measure the density of afferents to SF1 neurons in the absence of BDNF. Physiological changes in body weight and circulating blood glucose were also evaluated in the mutant mice.
Our findings suggest that BDNF is required to establish normal densities of GABAergic afferents onto SF1 neurons located in the ventrolateral part of the VMH.

In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of 'uncontrolled HT' during background therapy in CAPD patients by using office measurements and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). We further determined whether intravascular volume status, assessed by inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD) index, contributes to higher blood pressure (BP) and increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI).
Seventy-four CAPD patients were included in the final analysis. All patients underwent echocardiographic examination and received ABPM. Patients undergoing CAPD were categorized into two groups: 'uncontrolled HT' (Group A) and 'normotensive and controlled HT' (Group B). Intravascular volume status was determined using the IVCD index and collapsibility index (CI) on the same day as ABPM.
The prevalence of HT was 84% when using office measurements and 82% when using daytime ABPM. Daytime BP was 147/92 mm Hg by office measurements and 145/91 mm Hg by ABPM (P>0.05). The prevalence of 'uncontrolled HT' measured by ABPM was 73% (n=54). Patients with uncontrolled HT (Group A) were taking more antihypertensive medications than patients with 'normotension and controlled HT' (Group B, n=20; 1.0+/-0.8 vs 0.5+/-0.7, P=0.008).

In order to understand in more detail the biological roles of afamin in bone metabolism, we investigated its effects on osteoclastic differentiation and bone resorption.
Osteoclasts were differentiated from mouse bone marrow cells. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells were considered as osteoclasts, and the resorption area was determined by incubating the cells on dentine discs. The intracellular cAMP level was determined using a direct enzyme immunoassay. Signaling pathways were investigated using western blot and RT-PCR. Recombinant afamin was administered exogenously to bone cell cultures.
Afamin stimulated both osteoclastogenesis and in vitro bone resorption. Consistently, the expressions of osteoclast differentiation markers were significantly increased by afamin. Although afamin mainly affected the late-differentiation stages of osteoclastogenesis, the expression levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-dependent signals were not changed. Afamin markedly decreased the levels of intracellular cAMP with reversal by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), a specific inhibitor of Gi-coupled receptor signaling. In addition, PTX almost completely blocked afamin-stimulated osteoclastogenesis.

We hypothesized that LBV patients would have a faster cognitive decline and shorter survival compared with patients with pure AD.
Prior reports have shown extrapyramidal signs to be associated with a poorer prognosis in AD. It has been suggested that LBV is often characterized by a rapidly progressive course. Few data are available regarding the rate of cognitive decline in autopsy-confirmed LBV dementia cases.
We searched the databases of the University of California-San Diego Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Consortium to Establish a Registry in Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) for dementia cases with 1) an autopsy diagnosis of definite or probable AD (CERAD criteria) with concomitant Lewy bodies and 2) longitudinal MMSE assessments. This resulted in a series of 40 LBV cases and 148 AD cases without Lewy bodies, with comparable baseline MMSE scores, age, and education. The rate of cognitive decline was calculated as the baseline MMSE -- final MMSE. Methods were devised to reduce floor effects on the MMSE.
The average rate of cognitive decline was -5.8 +/- 4.5 points/y in LBV and -4.1 +/- 3.0 points/y in AD (t-test, p < 0.01). The LBV group declined a similar amount on the MMSE (means, -10.0 versus -9.6 points) over a significantly shorter time interval (1.9 versus 2.7 years; p = 0.005) than did AD patients.

The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women.

Cross-sectional analyses of the association between age, renal function and its modification by insulin were performed by means of linear regression. Renal function was assessed as 24-h creatinine clearance (CrCl) and 24-h urinary albumine excretion (UAE).
Age was 48 +/- 12 (range: 28-75) years, 44% were male, CrCl was 100 +/- 26 ml/min and UAE was 7.0 (5.4-10.7)] mg/24 h. The results confirmed a parabolic relation between age and renal function. Fasting insulin modified these parabolic relationships of age with CrCl and UAE (P < 0.001 for both interaction terms), in such a way that hyperinsulinaemia is associated with a stronger inverse parabolic relation between age and CrCl, and stronger positive parabolic relation between age and UAE at an older age than lower insulin concentrations.",Does fasting insulin modify the relation between age and renal function?,"No. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin does not accelerate the age-related decline of renal function in the general non-diabetic population. This indicates that insulin resistance, and the concomitant compensatory hyperinsulinaemia do not contribute to the increased incidence in end-stage renal disease.",FAIL,pubmedQA
1515,27216167,"The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients who were referred to specialist care after reporting gynecological cancer alarm symptoms to their general practitioner. We sought to investigate whether contact with specialist care was associated with lifestyle factors or socioeconomic status.
Nationwide population-based prospective cohort study in Denmark, based on a random sample of 51 090 women aged 20 years or older from the general population. A web-based questionnaire regarding gynecological alarm symptoms and lifestyle was distributed to the invited individuals. Data about contact with specialist care were obtained from the National Patient Register and the National Health Insurance Service Registry, whereas information about socioeconomic status was collected from Statistics Denmark. Main outcome measures were percentages of patients having contact with specialist care and odds ratios (ORs) for associations between specialist care contact, lifestyle factors and socioeconomic status.
The study included 25 866 nonpregnant women; 2957 reported the onset of at least one gynecological cancer alarm symptom, and 683 of these (23.1%) reported symptoms to their general practitioner. The proportion of individuals having contact with specialist care ranged from 39.3% (pain during intercourse) to 47.8% (bleeding during intercourse). Individuals with higher educational level had significantly higher odds of contact with a specialist (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.17-2.95).",Gynecological cancer alarm symptoms: is contact with specialist care associated with lifestyle and socioeconomic status?,Yes.

Because polarized human T(H)2 cells express a functional CXCR3 chemokine receptor, we evaluated the effects of a selective CXCR3 inhibitor in a mouse model of allergic airway disease.
Ovalbumin-specific CD8(+) T effector cells were generated from OT-1 mice in the presence of interleukin 2. The activity of a CXCR3 inhibitor was examined in vitro by monitoring Ca(2+) influx after receptor ligation. In vivo, the activity was assessed in sensitized and challenged mice by monitoring airway function, inflammatory parameters, including cellular infiltrates and cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Approximately 40% of CD8(+) T effector cells expressed the CXCR3 receptor. In vitro, CXCR3 antagonism reduced Ca(2+) influx after receptor engagement. In contrast, the CXCR3 antagonist had little to no effect on airway function or inflammatory parameters despite adequate exposure levels.",Does targeting CXCR3 reduce ligand-induced T-cell activation but not development of lung allergic responses?,Yes.

1933,22246633,"Significant joint pain is usually widespread beyond the affected joint, which results from the sensitization of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system (central sensitization). This study was undertaken to explore whether the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the joint induces central sensitization, whether joint inflammation causes the release of IL-6 from the spinal cord, and whether spinal IL-6 contributes to central sensitization.
In anesthetized rats, electrophysiologic recordings of spinal cord neurons with sensory input from the knee joint were made. Neuronal responses to mechanical stimulation of the rat knee and leg were monitored. IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) were applied to the knee joint or the spinal cord. Spinal release of IL-6 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Soluble gp130, which neutralizes IL-6/sIL-6R, was spinally applied during the development of joint inflammation or during established inflammation.
A single injection of IL-6/sIL-6R into the rat knee joint as well as application of IL-6/sIL-6R to the rat spinal cord significantly increased the responses of spinal neurons to mechanical stimulation of the knee and ankle joint, i.e., induced central sensitization. Application of soluble gp130 to the rat spinal cord attenuated this effect of IL-6. The development of knee inflammation in the rat caused spinal release of IL-6. Spinal application of soluble gp130 attenuated the development of inflammation-evoked central sensitization but did not reverse it.",Is spinal interleukin-6 an amplifier of arthritic pain in the rat?,No. Our findings indicate that the generation of joint pain in the rat involves only IL-6 in the joint and not IL-6 released from the spinal cord. Spinal IL-6 does not contribute to central sensitization and thus does not promote the widespread hyperalgesia observed in the course of joint disease.,FAIL,pubmedQA

Our objective was to determine in the setting of a controlled feeding study, if AA women required fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight.
This analysis includes 206 women (73% AA), aged 22-75 years, who participated in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial-a multicenter, randomized, controlled, feeding study comparing the effects of 3 dietary patterns on blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. After a 3-week run-in, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 dietary patterns for 8 weeks. Calorie intake was adjusted during feeding to maintain stable weight. The primary outcome of this analysis was average daily calorie (kcal) intake during feeding.
AA women had higher baseline weight and body mass index than non-AA women (78.4 vs 72.4 kg, P<.01; 29.0 vs 27.6 kg/m(2), P<.05, respectively). During intervention feeding, mean (SD) kcal was 2168 (293) in AA women and 2073 (284) in non-AA women. Mean intake was 94.7 kcal higher in AA women than in non-AA women (P<.05).

1822,22223149,"Although C-reactive protein (CRP) is significantly increased in patients with diabetic nephropathy, whether CRP exerts direct proinflammatory effects on human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) is still unclear.
HK-2 cells were incubated with purified CRP at clinically relevant concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μg/ml). The protein and transcript levels of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined by ELISA and RT-PCR. Phosphorylation of p38MAPK was investigated through Western blot analysis in HK-2 cells induced by CRP. The activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was studied via EMSA. A specific p38MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) and an NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC; pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) were used to analyze the signal transduction in CRP induction. To explore the direct or indirect role of CRP in HK-2 cells, IL-6 or TSP-1 antibodies were used. The expression of IL-6, TSP-1 and transforming growth factor-β(1 )(TGF-β(1)) were determined through Western blot analysis in HK-2 cells.
In HK-2 cells, purified CRP significantly induced protein release and mRNA expression of IL-6 and TSP-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. TGF-β(1) protein was overexpressed in HK-2 cells induced by CRP, which cannot be inhibited by IL-6 or TSP-1 antibodies. CRP triggered phosphorylation of p38MAPK and activation of NF-κB-mediated signal transduction.

For the specific assessment of LMVD and LVI, 393 tissue samples from a prospective tissue databank of esophageal adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and their precursor lesions were included into this study. LMVD and LVI were assessed by immunostaining for podoplanin, a selective marker of lymphatic endothelium. In addition the peritumoral inflammatory stroma reaction (ISR) was assessed.
Patients with high LMVD had a significant increased risk to develop LVI (P = .00123; coefficient of regression [CR] 0.27) and lymph node metastasis (P = .00233), independent of the tumor's histology. During a follow-up of 52 months, patients with high LMVD had a significantly reduced overall survival (OS; P < .001; 5-year OS 30% vs 54%) and disease-free survival (DFS; P < .001; 5-year DFS 28% vs 48%). OS (P < .001; 5-year OS 14% vs 60%) and DFS (P < .001; 5-year DFS 14% vs 49%) were significantly reduced in patients with present LVI. In invasive cancer, LMVD was significantly increased compared with precursor lesions (P = .008). The amount of ISR correlated significantly with LMVD.",Does lymphangiogenesis and lymphovascular invasion diminish prognosis in esophageal cancer?,No. Our data provide evidence that lymphangiogenesis does not play a significant role in esophageal cancer. Patients with high lymphangiogenic tumor activity do not represent candidates for lymphangiogenesis-associated therapies.,FAIL,pubmedQA
1617,20159833,"Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored as a risk factor in cardiac surgery. Where elderly patients are increasingly referred for cardiac surgery, the prevalence of a frail group among these is also on the rise. We assessed frailty as a risk factor for adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery.
Functional measures of frailty and clinical data were collected prospectively for all cardiac surgery patients at a single center. Frailty was defined as any impairment in activities of daily living (Katz index), ambulation, or a documented history of dementia. Of 3826 patients, 157 (4.1%) were frail. Frail patients were older, were more likely to be female, and had risk factors for adverse surgical outcomes. By logistic regression, frailty was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0), as well as institutional discharge (odds ratio 6.3, 95% CI 4.2 to 9.4). Frailty was an independent predictor of reduced midterm survival (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.2).",Are frail patients at increased risk for mortality and prolonged institutional care after cardiac surgery?,"Yes. Frailty is a risk for postoperative complications but is not an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, institutional discharge, or reduced midterm survival. Frailty screening improves risk assessment in cardiac surgery patients and may identify a subgroup of patients who may benefit from innovative processes of care.",FAIL,pubmedQA
1542,24614789,"Postoperative CSF fistulas were described in 16 of 198 patients (8%) who underwent spine surgery between 2009 and 2010. The choice of the therapeutic strategy was based on the clinical condition of the patients, taking into account the possibility to maintain the prone position continuously and the risk of morbidity due to prolonged bed rest. Six patients were treated conservatively (position prone for three weeks), ten patients were treated by positioning an external CSF lumbar drainage for ten days. The mean follow-up period was ten months.
All patients healed their wound properly and no adverse events were recorded. Patients treated conservatively were cured in a mean period of 30 days, while patients treated with CSF drainage were cured in a mean period of 10 days.",Is lumbar drainage of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula after spine surgery effective?,Yes. Lumbar drainage seems to be effective and safe both in preventing CSF fistula in cases of small dural tears and debilitated/irradiated patients and in treating CSF leaks.,FAIL,pubmedQA
1720,22682966,"Serum concentration of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is used as a biomarker in clinical practice. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the mechanism by which AMH is regulated in granulosa cells (GC). An important first step in understanding AMH regulation is to determine which factors up-regulate AMH expression.
Human GC, obtained from 28 women undergoing oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization, were stimulated with various intraovarian cytokines including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, -6, -7 -15, activin-A and growth differentiation factor (GDF)-9 (100 ng/ml). The expression of AMH mRNA was evaluated with reverse transcription and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and AMH protein in cultured supernatant was measured with EIA kit.
BMP-2, -6, -7 and -15, but not activin-A and GDF-9, significantly induced AMH expression in GC at mRNA and protein level, while all stimuli increased FSH receptor mRNA and decreased steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) mRNA level.",Is anti-Mullerian hormone ( AMH ) induced by bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) cytokines in human granulosa cells?,"Yes. Among the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily, BMP-2, -6, -7 and -9 significantly induced AMH expression in human GC.",FAIL,pubmedQA
1676,23708554,"To investigate the different effects of heroin and milk in activating the corticostriatal system that plays a critical role in reward reinforcement learning.
Male SD rats were trained daily for 15 d to self-administer heroin or milk tablets in a classic runway drug self-administration model. Immunohistochemical assay was used to quantify Arc protein expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the ventrolateral striatum (VLS) in response to chronic self-administration of heroin or milk tablets. NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 (0.1 mg/kg) or dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.03 mg/kg) were intravenously injected at the same time as heroin was infused intravenously.
Runway training with heroin resulted in robust enhancement of Arc expression in the mPFC, the NAc and the DMS on d 1, 7, and 15, and in the VLS on d 1 and d 7. However, runway training with milk led to increased Arc expression in the mPFC, the NAc and the DMS only on d 7 and/or d 15 but not on d 1. Moreover, runway training with milk failed to induce increased Arc protein in the VLS. Both heroin-seeking behavior and Arc protein expression were blocked by MK801 or SCH23390 administration.",Is differential expression of Arc in the mesocorticolimbic system involved in drug and natural rewarding behavior in rats?,Yes. The DMS is likely to be critically involved in drug-seeking behavior. The NMDA- and D1 receptor-dependent Arc expression is important in drug-seeking behavior.,FAIL,pubmedQA
1820,26741117,"Physical inactivity is associated with increased risk for morbidity and mortality and contributes to health care costs. Although data supporting the secondary preventive benefits of being physically active continues to grow, there is limited data on the prevalence of sufficient volume of leisure-time physical activity among individuals diagnosed with chronic disease.
To describe the association between select chronic diseases and the prevalence of sufficient volume of aerobic leisure-time physical activity to achieve substantial health benefits (i.e., ≥150 min·wk) among adults in the United States.
Self-reported leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and history of select chronic diseases were obtained from a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized civilian adults 18 yr or older in the United States who participated in the 2014 National Health Interview Survey (n = 36,697).
Among all adults, the prevalence of sufficient volume of aerobic LTPA was 50.1% ± 0.5% (mean ± standard error). This prevalence was inversely related to age and was lower in women (47.1% ± 0.6%) compared with men (53.4% ± 0.6%; P < 0.001). Prevalence of sufficient volume of aerobic LTPA was lower for each chronic disease (prevalence range = 26.1%-48.6%) compared with apparently healthy adults (53.6% ± 0.7%). Relative to no chronic disease, each additional chronic disease was associated with an odds ratio of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.85; P < 0.001) for sufficient volume of aerobic LTPA.",Does prevalence of Physical Activity be Lower among Individuals with Chronic Disease?,Yes. The prevalence of sufficient volume of aerobic LTPA to achieve substantial health benefits is inversely related to age and is higher among women and individuals with a chronic disease. Systems to regularly assess physical activity are needed as well as programs to help individuals be more active.,FAIL,pubmedQA
1653,22612914,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are related arrhythmias with common triggers, yet in individual patients either AF or AFL often predominates. We performed detailed electrophysiologic (EP) and electroanatomic (EA) studies of the right atrium (RA) in patients with AF and AFL to determine substrate differences that may explain the preferential expression of AF/AFL in individual patients.
Patients with AF (n = 13) were compared to patients with persistent AFL (n = 10). Detailed studies were performed, and 3-dimensional electroanatomic mapping studies were created and the RA was divided into 4 segments for regional analysis. Global, septal, lateral, anterior, and posterior segments were compared for analysis of: bipolar voltage; proportion of low-voltage areas and areas of electrical silence; conduction times; and proportion of abnormal signals (fractionated signals and double potentials).
Compared to patients with AF, patients with AFL had (1) lower bipolar voltage and an increase in the proportion of low-voltage areas; (2) an increase in the proportion of complex signals; and (3) prolongation of activation times.",Is right atrial remodeling more advanced in patients with atrial flutter than with atrial fibrillation?,"No. Patients with AF showed more advanced remodeling than patients with AFL with slowed conduction, lower voltage areas with regions of electrical silence, and a greater proportion of complex signals, particularly in the posterior RA. These changes facilitate the stabilization of AF and may explain why some patients are more likely to develop AF as a sustained clinical arrhythmia.",FAIL,pubmedQA
1731,16775432,"The prognostic role of tumor biological markers (biomarkers) in predicting recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated in this study, the results of which may help to select appropriate candidates for liver transplantation (LT).
Tissue samples from 82 HCC patients with cirrhosis who had undergone LT were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies of anti-CD147, anti-matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Tumor microvessel density (MVD) was evaluated by using CD34. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify the relevant prognostic factors.
A significant correlation was found between the expression of CD147, VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9 and MVD-CD34 in HCC. Tumor CD147 expression (P < 0.0001), tumor MVD-CD34 (P < 0.0001), MMP-9 in stromal compartment (P = 0.0257) and tumor VEGF expression (P = 0.0335) were significantly associated with the recurrence in HCC patients after LT. Univariate analysis showed that strong CD147 expression and high MVD-CD34 were significantly associated with poor tumor recurrence-free survival after LT (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis indicated that CD147 (P = 0.0001), MVD-CD34 (P = 0.0118), MMP-2 (P = 0.0312) and MMP-9 (P = 0.0280) in stromal compartment were all significant predictors in predicting HCC recurrence, while VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in tumor compartment were not significantly associated with poor prognosis.","Are cD147 , MMP-2 , MMP-9 and MVD-CD34 significant predictors of recurrence after liver transplantation in hepatocellular carcinoma patients?","Yes. The tumor biomarkers CD147 and MVD-CD34 are more feasible markers for rational selection of LT candidates with HCC.
