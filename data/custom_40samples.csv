Most people live within driving distance of wonderful hiking spots and discovering these places is a good way of getting to know an area. Here's a look at some of the benefits of hiking. Outdoor Hiking Promotes Mental Health. Hiking is much more varied than many other types of exercise, particularly those undertaken in a gym.

passage 2:Being exposed to sunshine will also increase your levels of vitamin D. Hiking is a cardiovascular activity, depending on how hard you push yourself during a hike, and thus has benefits for your cardiovascular system, such as reducing the chances of heart disease, and increasing your overall fitness.

passage 3:Research shows that hiking has a positive impact on combating the symptoms of stress and anxiety, says Gregory A. Miller, PhD, president of the American Hiking Society. Being in nature is ingrained in our DNA, and we sometimes forget that.

passage 2:Being toned or being defined means only one thing. It is when you have muscle, and when you have a low enough body fat percentage so that this muscle can be seen. So, the less fat you have covering your muscles, the more “tone” and “definition” you will appear to have.

",why am i not getting a toned body if i do extersice every day,"Based on the provided passages, here's my answer:

If you are not getting a toned body despite exercising every day, it could be due to two reasons:

1. Lack of muscle mass: As passage 1 states, having muscle is essential for having a toned body. If you don't have enough muscle mass, no amount of exercise will give you a toned appearance. You may need to focus on building muscle through strength training exercises before worrying about reducing body fat.
2. High body fat percentage: Passage 2 emphasizes that having a low body fat percentage is necessary to achieve a toned look. If you have a high body fat percentage, it will be harder to see your muscle definition, regardless of how much you exercise. To reduce body fat, you may need to adjust your diet and focus on burning fat through cardiovascular exercises.

Therefore, to get a toned body, you may need to prioritize building muscle through strength training and reducing body fat through a balanced diet and cardio exercises.",FAIL,RAGTruth

",how do i breed a shugabeats in my singing monsters,"Based on the given passages, here's how you can breed a Shugabeats in My Singing Monsters:

To breed a Shugabeats, you need to use the Shugabush and the Furcorn in the Shugabush Island breeding structure. Specifically, you need to combine the Shugabush and Furcorn in the breeding structure to get this monster.

As mentioned in passage 2, breeding the monsters left or right does not matter. However, it's important to note that breeding is not a guaranteed process, and you may need to try multiple times to successfully breed the Shugabeats.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the Shugabeats is a Generation 2 monster, so you will need to have both a Generation 1 monster and another monster of any level to create it. If you don't have a Generation 1 monster, you can use a basic monster and a Generation 1 monster to create a Generation 2 monster.

Finally, it's important to note that the breeding process can be affected by the elements of the monsters being bred. For example, the Shugabeats possesses the Water element, so breeding it with a monster that has the Water element will increase the chances of getting a Shugabeats as an offspring.",FAIL,RAGTruth

Notwithstanding, knowledge about the target genes mediating its biological and pathological functions remains limited. We therefore aimed to identify and characterize novel EVI1 target genes in human myeloid cells.
U937T_EVI1, a human myeloid cell line expressing EVI1 in a tetracycline regulable manner, was subjected to gene expression profiling. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the regulation of membrane-spanning-4-domains subfamily-A member-3 (MS4A3) by EVI1. Reporter constructs containing various parts of the MS4A3 upstream region were employed in luciferase assays, and binding of EVI1 to the MS4A3 promoter was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. U937 derivative cell lines experimentally expressing EVI1 and/or MS4A3 were generated by retroviral transduction, and tested for their tumorigenicity by subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficient mice.
Gene expression microarray analysis identified 27 unique genes that were up-regulated, and 29 unique genes that were down-regulated, in response to EVI1 induction in the human myeloid cell line U937T. The most strongly repressed gene was MS4A3, and its down-regulation by EVI1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR in additional, independent experimental model systems. MS4A3 mRNA levels were also negatively correlated with those of EVI1 in several published AML data sets. Reporter gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that EVI1 regulated MS4A3 via direct binding to a promoter proximal region. Experimental re-expression of MS4A3 in an EVI1 overexpressing cell line counteracted the tumor promoting effect of EVI1 in a murine xenograft model by increasing the rate of apoptosis.",Does eVI1 promote tumor growth via transcriptional repression of MS4A3?,"Yes.

Patients who had faced at least 1 experience of abuse (physical, sexual, or emotional) or neglect (physical or emotional) were classified according to age at the time of the first exposure (early trauma: before 12 years of age; late trauma: from age 12 through 16 years) and then compared with unexposed patients (nontrauma). The level of symptoms was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Young Mania Rating Scale, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale.
Exposure to 1 or more forms of trauma before 16 years of age was present in 31.63% of patients. Comparisons over the 3 years of treatment with the nontrauma patients revealed that (1) patients with early trauma showed consistently higher levels of positive (P = .006), depressive (P = .001), manic (P = .006), and negative (P = .029) symptoms and (2) patients with late trauma showed only more negative symptoms (P = .029).",Does age at the time of exposure to trauma modulate the psychopathological profile in patients with early psychosis?,"Yes.

19357361,"Identifying the cues required for the survival and development of photoreceptors is essential for treating retinal neurodegeneration. The authors previously established that glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulates proliferation and that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) promotes photoreceptor survival and differentiation. Later findings that ceramide triggers photoreceptor apoptosis suggested sphingolipids might also control photoreceptor development. The present study investigated whether sphingosine-1-phophate (S1P), which promotes survival and differentiation in several cell types, regulates photoreceptor proliferation and differentiation and whether it is a mediator in GDNF and DHA effects.
Rat retina neuronal cultures were supplemented at day 0 or 1 with S1P, GDNF, or DHA and were treated with DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine to inhibit S1P synthesis or with brefeldin A (BFA) to block intracellular trafficking. Proliferation was quantified to determine bromodeoxyuridine uptake and number of mitotic figures. Opsin, peripherin, and sphingosine kinase (SphK), the enzyme required for S1P synthesis, were quantified by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis.
S1P increased the proliferation of photoreceptor progenitors. It also stimulated the formation of apical processes, enhanced opsin and peripherin expression, and promoted their localization in these processes; DHA had similar effects. BFA prevented S1P and DHA enhancement of apical process formation without affecting opsin expression. GDNF and DHA enhanced SphK expression in photoreceptors, while inhibiting S1P synthesis blocked GDNF mitogenic effects and DHA effects on differentiation.",Is sphingosine-1-phosphate a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in retina photoreceptors?,"Yes. The authors propose S1P as a key regulator in photoreceptor development. GDNF and DHA might upregulate SphK levels to promote S1P synthesis, which would initially promote proliferation and then advance photoreceptor differentiation.",PASS,pubmedQA
11683916,"DNA replication-related element binding factor (DREF) has been suggested to be involved in regulation of DNA replication- and proliferation-related genes in Drosophila. While the effects on the mutation in the DNA replication-related element (DRE) in cultured cells have been studied extensively, the consequences of elevating wild-type DREF activity in developing tissues have hitherto remained unclear.
We over-expressed DREF in the wing imaginal disc using a GAL4-UAS targeted expression system in Drosophila. Over-expression of DREF induced a notching wing phenotype, which was associated with ectopic apoptosis. A half reduction of the reaper, head involution defective and grim gene dose suppressed this DREF-induced notching wing phenotype. Furthermore, this was also the case with co-expression of baculovirus P35, a caspase inhibitor. In addition, over-expression of the 32 kDa boundary element-associated factor (BEAF-32), thought to compete against DREF for common binding sites in genomic regions, rescued the DREF-induced notching wing phenotype, while a half reduction of the genomic region, including the BEAF-32 gene, exerted enhancing effects. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for a genetic interaction between DREF and BEAF-32.",Does over-expression of DREF in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc induce apoptosis and a notching wing phenotype?,Yes. The DREF-induced notching wing phenotype is caused by induction of apoptosis in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc.,PASS,pubmedQA
20521332,"Among people with arthritis, the need for work transitions may signal a risk for more adverse work outcomes in the future, such as permanent work loss. Our aim was to evaluate the ability of the Work Instability Scale for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA-WIS) to predict arthritis-related work transitions within a 12-month period.
Workers with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 250) from 3 clinical sites participated in self-administered surveys that assessed the impact of health on employment at multiple time points over 12 months. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to assess the ability of the RA-WIS (range 0-23, where 23 = highest work instability) to predict 4 types of work transition: reductions in work hours, disability leaves of absence, changes in job/occupation, or temporary unemployment, assembled as a composite outcome. Covariates assessed include age, sex, education, marital status, income, pain intensity, disease duration, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCCs) were also assessed to further examine the predictive ability of the RA-WIS and to determine optimal cut points for predicting specific work transitions.
After 12 months, 21.7% (n = 50 of 230) of the participants had indicated at least one arthritis-related work transition. Higher baseline RA-WIS was predictive of such an outcome (relative risk [RR] 1.05 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.00-1.11]), particularly at >17 (RR 2.30 [95% CI 1.11-4.77]). The RA-WIS cut point of >13 was found to be most accurate for prediction (AUROCC 0.68 [95% CI 0.58-0.78]).",Does the Work Instability Scale for rheumatoid arthritis predict arthritis-related work transitions within 12 months?,"No. The RA-WIS did not demonstrate the ability to predict arthritis-related work transitions within a short timeframe, and is not a promising measurement candidate for risk prognostication where work disability outcomes are of concern.",FAIL,pubmedQA
9602458,"This paper assesses the usefulness of the Child Health Computing System as a source of information about children with cerebral palsy.
A comparative survey of information held on the Child Health Computing System (CHCS) and the Northern Ireland Cerebral Palsy Register (NICPR) in one Health and Social Services Board in Northern Ireland was carried out. The sample comprised children with cerebral palsy aged 5-9 years.
Of the 135 cases recorded on the NICPR, 47 per cent were not found on the CHCS; the majority of these children had no computer record of any medical diagnosis. Of the 82 cases recorded on the CHCS, 10 (12 per cent) were not found on the NICPR; five of these cases (6 per cent) were found on follow-up not to have CP.",Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy?,"Yes. The Child Health Computing System (CHCS) effectively identifies children with cerebral palsy, providing reliable data for needs assessment and surveillance comparable to that of specialist case registers.",FAIL,pubmedQA
24366371,"High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is the most commonly used sweetener in the United States. Some studies show that HFCS consumption correlates with obesity and insulin resistance, while other studies are in disagreement. Owing to conflicting and insufficient scientific evidence, the safety of HFCS consumption remains controversial.
We investigated the metabolic consequences of mice fed a (a) regular diet, (b) 'Western' high-fat diet or (c) regular diet supplemented with 8% HFCS in drinking water (to mimic soft drinks) for 10 months. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) have emerged as a major pathogenic factor for obesity and insulin resistance. ATMs consist of proinflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(+) macrophages and anti-inflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(-) macrophages. In this study, we assessed the effects of HFCS on ATMs in intra-abdominal fat.
We found that HFCS feeding in mice induced more severe adipose inflammation and insulin resistance than even the higher-calorie-containing 'Western' high-fat diet, and these HFCS-induced deleterious effects were independent of calorie intake or body fat content. We showed that similar to 'Western' high-fat diet, HFCS triggered a robust increase of both proinflammatory ATMs and anti-inflammatory ATMs in intra-abdominal fat. Remarkably, however, the anti-inflammatory ATMs were much less abundant in HFCS-fed mice than in high-fat-fed mice. Furthermore, we showed that deletion of the ghrelin receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor, GHS-R) ameliorates HFCS-induced adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. HFCS-fed GHS-R-null mice exhibit decreased proinflammatory ATMs in intra-abdominal fat, reduced adipose inflammation and attenuated liver steatosis.",Does ghrelin receptor regulate HFCS-induced adipose inflammation and insulin resistance?,"No. Our studies demonstrate that HFCS has detrimental effects on metabolism, suggesting that dietary guidelines on HFCS consumption for Americans may need to be revisited. GHS-R deletion does not mitigate the effects of HFCS on adipose inflammation and insulin resistance, suggesting that GHS-R antagonists may not represent a novel therapy for insulin resistance.",FAIL,pubmedQA
20967283,"The liver plays a central role in nutrient and xenobiotic metabolism, but its functionality declines with age. Senior dogs suffer from many of the chronic hepatic diseases as elderly humans, with age-related alterations in liver function influenced by diet. However, a large-scale molecular analysis of the liver tissue as affected by age and diet has not been reported in dogs.
Liver tissue samples were collected from six senior (12-year old) and six young adult (1-year old) female beagles fed an animal protein-based diet (APB) or a plant protein-based diet (PPB) for 12 months. Total RNA in the liver tissue was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip® Canine Genome Arrays. Using a 2.0-fold cutoff and false discovery rate <0.10, our results indicated that expression of 234 genes was altered by age, while 137 genes were differentially expressed by diet. Based on functional classification, genes affected by age and/or diet were involved in cellular development, nutrient metabolism, and signal transduction. In general, gene expression suggested that senior dogs had an increased risk of the progression of liver disease and dysfunction, as observed in aged humans and rodents. In particular for aged liver, genes related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and glycolysis were up-regulated, whereas genes related to regeneration, xenobiotic metabolism, and cholesterol trafficking were down-regulated. Diet-associated changes in gene expression were more common in young adult dogs (33 genes) as compared to senior dogs (3 genes).",Do age and diet affect gene expression profiles in canine liver tissue?,"Yes. Our results provide molecular insight pertaining to the aged canine liver and its predisposition to disease and abnormalities. Therefore, our data may aid in future research pertaining to age-associated alterations in hepatic function or identification of potential targets for nutritional management as a means to decrease incidence of age-dependent liver dysfunction. Interestingly, diet-associated changes in gene expression were more common in senior dogs compared to young adult dogs.",FAIL,pubmedQA
25623806,"Our goal was to identify brain structures responsible for pain-related autonomic changes by the correlation of simultaneously acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Eighteen healthy men (age: 22.89 ± 1.96) were involved. Painful sensation was evoked by heat. Simultaneously recorded brain fMRI and ECG data during pain were compared to data acquired during a non-painful heat sensation. From the ECG data, time- and frequency domain parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) were extracted.
We found that: (1) among the common elements of both pain network and central autonomic network (CAN) only the medial prefrontal frontal cortex (MPFC) showed significant correlation with HRV; (2) the parasympathetic response to the painful stimuli showed a positive, while the sympathetic response a negative association with pain related BOLD-signal change observed in MPFC; (3) time domain parameters of HRV were negatively associated with MPFC activation.",Is pain-related autonomic response modulated by the medial prefrontal cortex : An ECG-fMRI study in men?,"No. The novelty of our study-compared to previous ECG-fMRI studies-is that we used pain as stimulus and investigated both frequency- and time-domain parameters of HRV. Compared to other stimuli used in earlier studies to activate the CAN, pain sensation can be standardized easier and might allow us to better understand the functional organization of CAN. The results of the current ECG-fMRI study may have direct clinical relevance in understanding the pathomechanisms of several clinical conditions.",FAIL,pubmedQA
