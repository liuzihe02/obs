Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and some viruses. The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information.

passage 2:DNA structure. DNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a nitrogen base. The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C).The order of these bases is what determines DNA's instructions, or genetic code.Similar to the way the order of letters in the alphabet can be used to form a word, the order of nitrogen bases in a DNA sequence forms genes, which in the language of the cell, tells cells how to make proteins.NA structure.

14513,"passage 1:An ad hominem (Latin for to the man or to the person), short for argumentum ad hominem, is an attack on an argument made by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, rather than attacking the argument directly.

passage 2:Abusive ad hominem usually involves attacking the traits of an opponent as a means to invalidate their arguments. Equating someone's character with the soundness of their argument is a logical fallacy.

passage 3:Poisoning the Well Fallacy. Poisoning the well is an ad hominem attack (see “Ad hominem,” above) on a person’s integrity or intelligence that takes place before the merits of a case can be considered. It redirects a discussion to the faults of one of the parties.

",What’s the difference between ad hominem fallacy and the poisoning the well fallacy?,"The main difference between ad hominem fallacy and poisoning the well fallacy is the timing of the attack. Ad hominem fallacy attacks the person making the argument instead of attacking the argument directly, but poisoning the well fallacy is a preemptive attack on a person's character or integrity before they have even made their argument. In other words, ad hominem fallacy is a reaction to an argument, while poisoning the well fallacy is a preemptive strike to discredit an opponent before they have a chance to present their argument.",PASS,RAGTruth

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are frequently used as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx). In this study, we analyzed changes in composition of the collagens as well as the synthesis or degradation of these collagens after prolonged LVAD support.
The ECM volume was quantified after Picro-Sirius red staining. With immunohistochemistry (IHC), Type I and Type III collagen proteins were analyzed and, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), collagen mRNA expression was analyzed. Collagen synthesis and degradation was studied by measuring N-terminal pro-peptide for Type I collagen (PINP), N-terminal pro-peptide for Type III collagen (PIIINP) and carboxyterminal telopeptide for Type I collagen (ICTP) in plasma.

As the composition of the herbal extract called Ob-X has been shown to have both anti-angiogenic and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-inhibiting activities, we hypothesized that growth of adipose tissue can be regulated by Ob-X.
The effects of Ob-X on angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling were measured using in vitro and ex vivo assays. The effects of Ob-X on adipose tissue growth were investigated in nutritionally obese mice.
Ob-X inhibited angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay in vitro and the rat aortic ring assay ex vivo. Ob-X also suppressed MMP activity in vitro. Administration of Ob-X to high fat diet-induced obese mice produced significant reductions in body weight gain and adipose tissue mass compared with control. The mass of both visceral (VSC) and subcutaneous (SC) fat was reduced in Ob-X-treated mice. The size of adipocytes in VSC and SC adipose tissues was also significantly reduced in Ob-X-treated mice. Ob-X treatment decreased the blood vessel density and MMP activity in VSC adipose tissues of nutritionally obese mice. Ob-X reduced mRNA levels of angiogenic factors (VEGF-A and FGF-2) and MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-9), whereas it increased mRNA levels of angiogenic inhibitors (TSP-1, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) in SC and VSC adipose tissues of nutritionally obese mice.",Does the anti-angiogenic herbal composition Ob-X inhibit adipose tissue growth in obese mice?,"Yes.

21801416,"It is now widely accepted that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical regulator of energy homeostasis. Recently, it has been shown to regulate circadian clocks. In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland.
All the subunits of AMPK that we studied were identified in all brain areas that were dissected but with some differences in their level of expression among structures. Metformin and AICAR both reduced (p<0.001 and p<0.01 respectively) the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion independently of insulin secretion. The i.c.v. injection of AICAR only tended (p = 0.1) to increase the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the paraventricular nucleus but significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated ACC in the paraventricular nucleus (p<0.001) and in the pineal gland (p<0.05).",The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK?,"Yes. Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for AMPK on the secretion of melatonin probably acting through the suprachiasmatic nucleus and/or directly in the pineal gland. We conclude that AMPK may act as a metabolic cue to modulate the rhythm of melatonin secretion.",FAIL,pubmedQA
27112610,"To identify the potential mutations in a Chinese pedigree with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and to analyze the genotype-phenotype relationship in this pedigree.
Clinical history and physical examinations, electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography (UCG), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data were obtained from 10 members of a three-generation Chinese family with HCM. A total of 96 genes related to hereditary cardiomyopathy were detected by exon and boarding intron analyses in the proband using second-generation sequencing. Mutations identified in the proband were confirmed by bi-directional Sanger sequencing in the rest 9 family members and 300 healthy controls.
Three mutations, including MYBPC3-P1208fs, ANK2-H556R and ANK2-P1974H, were identified in this pedigree. MYBPC3-P1208fs gene mutation was detected in 3 family members (proband, his mother and son), while this mutation was not detected in the rest family members. HCM was diagnosed in the proband and his mother by ECG, UCG and CMR. Son of the proband demonstrated early phenotype of HCM: although UCG and CMR were normal, ECG showed sinus bradycardia and paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias as well as ST segment changes. The onset age of HCM diagnosis of the proband and his mother was 42 and 50 years old, presented with palpitation and chest pain, and myocardial fibrosis sign in CMR. Furthermore, we found that left ventricular myocardial fibrosis is related to ECG changes (increasing r wave, ST segment change) in the proband and his mother. No HCM phenotype was evidenced in the 7 family members carrying ANK2-H556R and ANK2-P1974H mutations.",Is [ P1208fs mutation in the cardiac myosin binding protein C associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a Chinese pedigree ]?,Yes. Our results show that MYBPC3-P1208fs gene mutation is associated HCM phenotype in this Chinese pedigree. This mutation is associated with myocardial fibrosis and ST changes in HCM phenotype in this pedigree while ANK2-H556R mutation is also related to HCM phenotype in this family.,FAIL,pubmedQA
12097847,"In patients with carotid artery occlusion (CAO), collateral flow may reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. Collateral flow via the ophthalmic artery (OphthA) and flow via leptomeningeal vessels have been considered secondary collaterals, which are recruited only if the primary collateral circulation via the circle of Willis is insufficient. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with symptomatic CAO who have secondary in addition to primary collaterals have a worse flow state of the brain than those without secondary collaterals, as measured by vascular reactivity testing.
We studied 70 patients with symptomatic CAO who were independent for their daily activities. In all patients, collateral circulation through the circle of Willis was present. Vascular reactivity, measured by means of transcranial Doppler sonography with carbogen inhalation, was compared between patients with and without secondary collaterals.
CO2 reactivity was lower in 64 patients with (mean +/- standard deviation 8 +/- 14%) than in 6 patients without secondary collaterals (33 +/- 18%) resulting in a mean difference of 24% (95% confidence interval 12-37%; p < 0.01).",Is collateral circulation via the ophthalmic artery or leptomeningeal vessels associated with impaired cerebral vasoreactivity in patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusion?,No. Patients with symptomatic CAO with collateral circulation through the OphthA or through leptomeningeal vessels in addition to collaterals via the circle of Willis have a better hemodynamic status of the brain than those with Willisian collaterals only. Therefore the presence of these collaterals may indicate sufficiency of collateral blood flow via the circle of Willis.,FAIL,pubmedQA
25155638,"Influenza vaccination remains below the federally targeted levels outlined in Healthy People 2020. Compared to non-Hispanic whites, racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to be vaccinated for influenza, despite being at increased risk for influenza-related complications and death. Also, vaccinated minorities are more likely to receive influenza vaccinations in office-based settings and less likely to use non-medical vaccination locations compared to non-Hispanic white vaccine users.
To assess the number of ""missed opportunities"" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings by race and ethnicity and the magnitude of potential vaccine uptake and reductions in racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination if these ""missed opportunities"" were eliminated.
National cross-sectional Internet survey administered between March 4 and March 14, 2010 in the United States.
Non-Hispanic black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic white adults living in the United States (N = 3,418).
We collected data on influenza vaccination, frequency and timing of healthcare visits, and self-reported compliance with a potential provider recommendation for vaccination during the 2009-2010 influenza season. ""Missed opportunities"" for seasonal influenza vaccination in office-based settings were defined as the number of unvaccinated respondents who reported at least one healthcare visit in the Fall and Winter of 2009-2010 and indicated their willingness to get vaccinated if a healthcare provider strongly recommended it. ""Potential vaccine uptake"" was defined as the sum of actual vaccine uptake and ""missed opportunities.""
The frequency of ""missed opportunities"" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings was significantly higher among racial and ethnic minorities than non-Hispanic whites. Eliminating these ""missed opportunities"" could have cut racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination by roughly one half.",Can routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings reduce racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination?,No. Routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings does not significantly impact racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination.,FAIL,pubmedQA
10331115,"All currently available atypical antipsychotics have, at clinically relevant doses: i) high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy; ii) greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy; and iii) a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when their D2 occupancy exceeds 80%. A review of pharmacologic and behavioral data suggested that amoxapine should also conform to this profile; therefore, we undertook a positron-emission tomography (PET) study of its 5-HT2 and D2 occupancy.
Seven healthy volunteers received 50-250 mg/day of amoxapine for 5 days and then had [11C]-raclopride and [18F]-setoperone PET scans.
5-HT2 receptors showed near saturation at doses of 100 mg/day and above. The D2 receptor occupancies showed a dose-dependent increase, never exceeding 80%; at all doses 5-HT2 occupancy exceeded D2 occupancy.",Is amoxapine an atypical antipsychotic?,"Yes. PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established typical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an 'atypical' antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.",FAIL,pubmedQA
