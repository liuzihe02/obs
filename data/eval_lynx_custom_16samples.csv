15712,lynx,1,"The output accurately reflects the information provided in the retrieved context, synthesizing details from the passages to explain the differences between sirloin steak and porterhouse steak. It correctly identifies that porterhouse steaks are larger and contain more tenderloin, while also noting that passage 3 does not contribute relevant information. Therefore, the output is faithful to the retrieved context."
16852,lynx,0,"The output is not fully faithful to the retrieved context because it includes details about the composition of red blood cells, specifically that they lack a nucleus and most organelles, which are not mentioned in the retrieved context. Additionally, while the retrieved context states that both types of cells have a cell membrane and cytoplasm, it does not clarify the differences in their composition. Therefore, the output introduces information that is not supported by the retrieved context."
halueval-252,lynx,1,"The retrieved context states that Patrick Brontë, the father of Maria Brontë, spent most of his adult life in England. The output 'England' directly corresponds to this information, confirming its accuracy. Therefore, the output is faithful to the contents of the retrieved context."
halueval-2227,lynx,1,"The retrieved context provides the birth date of Richard Dale Barnes, who was the head coach during the 2009-2010 season, confirming the relevance of the information. Since the output directly states his birth date as July 17, 1954, it is faithful to the retrieved context. Therefore, the output accurately answers the input based on the provided context."
halueval-7375,lynx,0,"The retrieved context provides information about Daulis Prescott's brother, Breidis Prescott, and mentions his nickname 'The Khanqueror'. However, the output incorrectly states that Daulis Prescott's brother has no nickname, which contradicts the information in the retrieved context. Therefore, the output is not faithful to the retrieved context."
halueval-1234,lynx,0,"The retrieved context states that GlaxoSmithKline has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, while the output incorrectly claims it is on NASDAQ. This discrepancy indicates that the output is not fully faithful to the information provided in the retrieved context, as the change in stock exchange is unsupported."
27330686,lynx,1,"The output accurately reflects the findings presented in the retrieved context, which indicates that simvastatin treatment did not significantly affect serum levels of Vitamin D. The study's design and results are clearly summarized, supporting the conclusion drawn in the output. Therefore, the output is faithful to the contents of the retrieved context."
15136629,lynx,0,"The output claims that weight-based emission scan durations from 1 to 3 minutes provide similar lesion detectability compared to 4-minute scans, which is not directly supported by the retrieved context. The retrieved context indicates that lesions were identified on 3- and 4-minute scans but does not confirm similar detectability for 1- to 3-minute scans. Therefore, the output is not fully faithful to the contents of the retrieved context."
23676712,lynx,0,"The output claims that the prevalence of disability is relatively low among late middle-aged women, which contradicts the retrieved context stating that nearly 25% reported moderate to extreme global disability, indicating a significant prevalence. Additionally, the retrieved context identifies several correlates of disability, further supporting the notion that disability is not rare in this population. Therefore, the output is not fully faithful to the contents of the retrieved context."
27541280,lynx,0,"The output claims that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with the relationship between insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in young obese children, which contradicts the retrieved context stating that the NAFLD·ISEN interaction was not significant. This indicates that the relationship between insulin secretion and sensitivity is the same for both NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups, making the output not faithful to the retrieved context. Therefore, the output does not accurately reflect the findings of the study."
financebench_id_05488,lynx,0,"The output is not fully faithful to the retrieved context because it incorrectly calculates the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income. The retrieved context provides the necessary figures for FY2020 and FY2021, which show an increase of $3,774 million, leading to a correct percentage change of 131.3%.

financebench_id_09952,lynx,1,"The output is faithful to the retrieved context as it correctly calculates Lockheed Martin's FY2022 return on assets (ROA) using the provided net income and average total assets. The retrieved context supplies the necessary figures: FY2022 net income of $5,732 million and average total assets of $51,876 million, leading to an accurate ROA of 0.11. Since the output matches this calculated value, it confirms the faithfulness of the response."
financebench_id_08167,lynx,0,"The output is not faithful to the retrieved context because it provides a net profit margin of 15.2%, which does not match the calculated value of 14.3% derived from the financial figures in the retrieved context. The calculation for net profit margin, based on net earnings and net sales, clearly shows a discrepancy. Therefore, the output fails to accurately reflect the information provided in the retrieved context."
financebench_id_07294,lynx,0,"The output is not fully faithful to the retrieved context because it does not accurately reflect the calculation of the asset turnover ratio based on the provided revenue and average total assets.
